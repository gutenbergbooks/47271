  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />WHEREIN THE QUICK AND THE DEAD MEET</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If there is one place, in the wide world, more
dreary and disconsolate-looking than another, on a
gusty evening in March, it is that part of Essex
which lies some twenty miles to the north of the
Thames, and is bordered nowhere, so far as the eye
can reach, by anything but flat and desolate marshlands,
and by swampy roads and fields. For there,
all the contrary winds of Heaven seem to meet, to
play a grand game of buffets with themselves, and
everything else which rises an inch or two above
the ground; there, the very sun, if he happen to
have shown his face at all during the day, sinks
more sullenly than anywhere else, as though disgusted
with the prospect, and glad to get to bed;
there, the few travellers who have been so unwise,
or so unfortunate, as to be left out of doors, are
surly in consequence, and give but grudging greeting
to any one they meet.</p>

<p class='c009'>On just such an evening as this a solitary man,
muffled to the eyes, fought a desperate battle with
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>the various winds, something to his own discomfiture,
and very much to the ruffling of his temper,
on the way to the small village of Bamberton. The
railway leaves off suddenly, some six miles from
Bamberton, and the man who would visit that interesting
spot must perforce pay for a fly at the
Railway Inn, if he desire to enter the place with
any ostentation, or must walk.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the case of this particular man, he desired, for
purposes of his own, to attract as little notice as
possible; and was, therefore, tramping through the
mud and a drizzling rain, as cheerfully as might be.
He was a tall, well-built man, of about eight-and-twenty
years of age; with strong, well-defined
features, rendered the more so by the fact that his
face was cleanly shaven; possibly from having led
a solitary life, he had a habit of communing with
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A cheery welcome, this, to one’s native land—to
one’s native place!” he muttered, bending his
head, as a fresh gust of wind and rain drove at him.
“Why—if the devil himself were in league against
me, and had made up his mind to oppose my coming,
he couldn’t fight harder than this! ’Pon my word,
it almost looks like a bad omen for you, Philip
Crowdy—a devilish bad omen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Despite the wind and the rain and the gathering
night, however, the man presently seated himself
on a stone, near the roadside, and within sight
of the twinkling lights of the village, as though he
has something weighty on his mind, which must be
thrashed out before he could proceed to his destination.
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>Despite the wind and the rain, too, he took
the matter quite good-humouredly, in putting a suppositious
case to himself—even doing it with some
jocularity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now Phil, my boy—you’ve got to be very careful.
There’s no getting away from the fact that
you are not wanted—and you certainly will not be
welcome. The likeness is all right; I’ve seen a
picture of the respected Dandy Chater—and there’s
nothing to be feared, from that point of view.
The only thing is, that I must feel my way, and
know exactly what I am doing. And, for the
moment, darkness suits me better than daylight.
My first business is to get as near to Dandy Chater
as possible, and observe him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tall man, bringing his ruminations to a close,
sat for a moment or two, deep in thought—so deep
in thought, indeed, that he did not hear the sound
of light steps approaching him, from the direction of
the village; and was absolutely unaware that there
was any other figure but himself in all the landscape,
until he felt a light touch on his shoulder,
and started hurriedly to his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Facing him, in the semi-darkness, was a young
girl, who, even by that light, he could see was
unmistakably pretty. She was quite young, and,
although her dress was poor and common, there
was an indefinable air of grace about her, which set
her apart—or seemed to do, in the man’s eyes—from
any mere rustic girl. To his surprise, she
stood quite still before him, with her eyes cast
down, as though waiting for him to speak. After
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>a moment or two of embarrassing silence, Mr. Philip
Crowdy spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter?” he asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl raised her eyes—and very beautiful eyes
they were, too, although they seemed haggard and
red, and even then had the traces of tears in them—and
looked steadily at him. Even though the man
knew that he had been mistaken by her for some one
else, there was no start of surprise on her part; he
knew, in an instant, that she thought she saw in him
the person she wanted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy, dear,” she said, appealingly—and her
voice had a faint touch of the rustic in it—“you
promised that you would see me again to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man had given a faint quick start of surprise,
at the mention of the name; he turned away
abruptly—partly in order to have time to collect
his thoughts, partly to hide his face from her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better and better!” he muttered to himself.
“Nearer and nearer! Now—who on earth is this,
and what is Dandy Chater’s little game?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t go down to the village, Dandy,” went
on the girl piteously. “You know why I can’t go.
You promised to meet me to-night, in the little wood
behind the mill—didn’t you, Dandy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—yes—I know,” replied the man, impatiently.
In reality, in this sudden surprising turn
of events, his one object was to gain time—to give
such replies as should lead her to state more fully
who she was, and what her errand might be.
“What then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be hurt, Dandy dear,” the girl went on,
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>coming timidly a little nearer to him. “You know
how much it means to me—my good name—everything.
I was afraid—afraid you might—might forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How piteously she said it—and what depth of
pleading there was in her eyes! She seemed little
more than a girl, and the man, looking at her, felt
a certain hot indignation growing in him against
the real Dandy Chater, who could have brought
tears to eyes which must once have been so innocent.
It was not his purpose, however, to undeceive
her; he had too much at stake for that; so he felt
his way cautiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shan’t forget; you need not fear. I will meet
you, as I have promised,” he replied slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very good to me, Dandy,” said the girl,
gratefully. “And you are going to take me to
London—aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>This had evidently been promised by the real
Dandy Chater, and Philip Crowdy felt that he must
deal delicately with the matter, as he had still much
to learn. Accordingly, pitiful though the thing
was, he took it half laughingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To London? But what am I to do with you
there. Where shall we go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed, to please his humour. “Why—Dandy
dear—how soon you forget! Didn’t you
promise that I should go with you to the old
place—there, I can see you’ve forgotten all about it
already—the old place at Woolwich—the Three
Watermen—near the river; didn’t you say we
might wait there until to-morrow? And then——Oh,
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>Dandy, the thought of it takes away my breath,
and makes my heart beat with joy and gratitude—and
then—we are to be married!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is some desperate game afoot here,”
thought Philip Crowdy to himself, as he stood in
the dark road, looking at the eager face of the girl.
“Why—in Heaven’s name, does he want to meet
her in a wood, if he’s going to take her to London?
I must follow this up, if possible, at any cost.”
Aloud he said, “Of course—how stupid of me; I’d
quite forgotten. And to-morrow Dandy Chater,
Esq., and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Patience Miller,” broke in the girl, quickly—“will
be man and wife—and Patience will be the
happiest girl in England!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got her name, by George!” muttered the man
to himself. “Poor girl—I hope to goodness the
man is dealing fairly with her.” Turning to the
girl again, he said carelessly—“Let me see, what
time did I say we were to meet in the wood?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At half-past seven,” replied the girl. “You
said we should have time to walk across the fields,
from there to the station, to catch the last train,
without any one seeing us—don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—yes, I remember,” replied the man. “I
shan’t be late; till then—good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had turned away, and had gone some few
paces down the road towards the village, when the
girl called piteously after him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy—you’re not going like that? Won’t
you—won’t you kiss me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man retraced his steps slowly. As, after a
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>moment’s hesitation, he put an arm carelessly round
her shoulders, and bent his face towards hers, he
looked fully and strongly into her eyes; but there
was no change in her expression—no faintest start
of suspicion or doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was a trial!” he muttered, when he had
started again towards the village, and had left her
standing in the road looking after him. “The likeness
must be greater even than I suspected. Now
to find Mr. Dandy Chater—or rather—to keep out
of his way, until I know what his movements are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Coming, in the darkness, into the little village—a
place consisting of one long straggling street
of cottages, running up a hill—he found the road
flanked on either side by a small inn. On the one
side—the right hand—was the Chater Arms; on
the other—the Bamberton Head. Standing between
them, and looking up the long straggling
street, Mr. Philip Crowdy could discern, in the distance,
perched on rising ground, the outlines of a
great house, with lights showing faintly here and
there in its windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s Chater Hall—evidently,” he said softly
to himself. “Now the question is, where is Mr.
Dandy Chater? Shall I go up to the Hall, and
reconnoitre the position, or shall I try one of the
inns? I think I’ll try one of the inns; if I happen
to drop into the wrong one, and he’s there, I must
trust to making a bolt for it; if he’s <i>not</i> there, I
think the likeness will serve, and I may hear something
which will be useful. Now, then—heads,
right—tails, left!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>He spun a coin in the air—looked at it closely—returned
it to his pocket—and turned to the left,
into the Bamberton Head. Knowing that any sign
of hesitation might mean his undoing, he thrust
open a door which led into the little parlour, and
boldly entered it. There were one or two men in
the room, and a big surly-looking giant of a fellow,
who appeared to be the landlord. The men exchanged
glances which, to the man keenly watchful
of every movement, seemed to be glances of surprise;
the surly landlord put a hand to his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evenin’, Muster Chater,” said the man. “’Tain’t
of’en as we sees anything o’ you this side the way,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wrong house,” thought Philip Crowdy. “So
much the better, perhaps; I am less likely to meet
the real man, until I wish to do so.” Aloud he said,
with a shrug of the shoulders—“Oh—anything for
a change. Bring me some brandy, it can’t be worse
than that at the other shop—and it may be better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A deal better, Muster Chater, take my word for
’t,” replied the landlord, hurrying away to execute
the order.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the time that the stranger sat there, and
had leisure to look about him, he became aware of
one unpleasant fact. He saw that, however great
might be their respect for the mere position of the
man they supposed him to be, there was a curious
resentment at his presence, and a distrust of him
personally, which was not to be disguised. When,
having leisurely drunk his brandy, he left the place,
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>to their evident relief, and came again out into the
darkness of the village street, he expressed the
opinion to himself, in one emphatic phrase, that
Dandy Chater was a bad lot.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the strangeness of his position, and in his uncertainty
as to what future course he was to take,
his interview with the girl, on the road outside the
village, had gone, for the time, clean out of his
mind; when he looked at his watch, he discovered,
to his dismay, that it was nearly eight o’clock.
More than that, he did not even know where the
wood of which she had spoken was situated, and he
dared not ask the way to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Trusting to blind chance to guide him, and looking
about anxiously over the flat landscape, for
anything at all answering the description of a mill,
or even of a wood, he lost more valuable time still;
and at last, in sheer desperation, remembering that
the last train for London started at a few minutes
to the hour of nine, he set off, at a rapid rate, for
the railway station—running along the road now
and then, in his anxiety not to miss it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the real Dandy Chater has kept his promise
to the girl, even so far as taking her to London is
concerned,” he muttered, as he ran on, “they’ve
met in the wood long ago, and are well on their
way to the station. I’ll follow them; that’s the
best course. Besides—I don’t like the look of that
business with the girl; her eyes seem to haunt me
somehow. If I miss them at the station, I can at
least go on to that place she mentioned at Woolwich,
and keep my eye on the man.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>The wind and rain were less heavy and boisterous
than they had been, and the moon was struggling
faintly through driving clouds. As the man
hurried along, seeing the lights of the station in
the distance before him, a figure suddenly broke
through the low hedge beside the road, scarcely
more than a hundred yards in advance, and ran on
in front, in the same direction. Philip Crowdy,
hearing the warning shriek of the train, hurried on
faster than before.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the very entrance of the station-yard was a
gas lamp, which served to light feebly the dreary-looking
muddy roads converging upon it. And,
beneath this lamp, the figure which had broken
through the hedge, and run on before, had stopped,
and was carefully scraping and shaking some heavy
wet clay from its boots. Catching a glimpse of the
face of the figure, as he hurried past, Crowdy, with
an exclamation, drew his hat down well over his
face, and pulled his coat collar higher.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no time even to get a ticket; Crowdy
raced across the booking-office, and reached the
platform just in time; wrenched open a door, and
jumped in. He heard a shout, and, looking out,
saw a porter pulling open another door, while the
man who had been so particular about his boots
sprang into the train. Then, the door was slammed,
and the train, already in motion, steamed out of
the station.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Crowdy leant back in the compartment in
which he found himself alone, and whistled softly.
“This is a new move,” he muttered, “Dandy Chater
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>himself—and without the girl. Well, most respectable
Great Eastern Railway Company,” he added,
with a laugh, apostrophising the name of the Company
staring at him from the wall of the carriage—“it
isn’t often that you carry, in one train, two
such queer people as you carry to-night!” Then,
becoming serious again, he said softly—“But I’d
like to know what’s become of the girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the train reached Liverpool Street, Philip
Crowdy remained in the carriage as long as possible,
in order to avoid meeting the other man; and,
on getting out, discovered to his annoyance that
the other man had vanished—swallowed up in the
restless crowds of people who were moving about
the platforms. However, having one faint clue to
guide him, he set off for Woolwich.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Three Watermen is a little old-fashioned
gloomy public-house, situated at the end of a narrow
street, which plunges down towards the river,
and on the very bank of that river itself. Indeed,
it is half supported, on the riverside, by huge
baulks of timber, round which the muddy water
creeps and washes; and it is the presiding genius,
as it were, over a number of tumble-down sheds
and out-houses, used for the storage of river lumber
of one sort or another, or, in some cases, not
used at all. And it is the resort of various riverside
men; with occasionally some stranger, who
appears to belong to salter waters, and to have lost
his way there, in getting to the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Outside this place, Philip Crowdy waited, for a
long time, in the shadow of a doorway, debating
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>with himself what to do. Being practically in
strange quarters, he had had to enquire every step
of the way, both as to his journey by train to Woolwich,
and afterwards, when he had reached the
place. In consequence, he had lost a very considerable
amount of time; and was well aware that,
if the man he pursued had come to the place at all,
he had had all the advantage, from the fact of
knowing the way clearly, and being able to make
straight for his destination. Under these circumstances,
it was quite impossible for Crowdy to
know whether the man was in the place, or, if so,
how long he had been there—or even if he had not
already left the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Turning over all these points in his mind, Crowdy
wandered, half aimlessly, down a little alley, which
led beside the Three Watermen towards the river.
He had just reached the end of it, and was shivering
a little, at the melancholy prospect of dark water
and darker mud before him, when a man, rushing
hurriedly from the direction of the water, almost
carried him off his legs; snapped out an oath at
him; and was gone up the alley, and into the street,
before Crowdy had recovered his breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“People seem in a hurry about these parts,” he
murmured to himself. “Now, I wonder what on
earth that fellow was running away from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Impelled, half by curiosity, and half by the restlessness
which possessed him, he turned and walked
some little distance, over a kind of dilapidated
wharf, in the direction from which the man had
come. The place was quite lonely and deserted,
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>and only the skeleton-like frames of some old
barges and other vessels, which some one, at some
remote period, had been breaking up, stood up
gaunt against the sky. Some darker object, among
some broken timbers at the very edge of the water,
attracted his attention; he went forward quickly,
and then, with a half-suppressed cry, threw himself
on his knees beside it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the body of a man, who had apparently
fallen just where he had been struck down; the
hand which Philip Crowdy touched was quite warm,
although the man was stone dead. But that was
not the strange part—that was not the reason why
the living man, bending close above the dead, stared
at the face as though he could never gaze enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>The faces that stared so grimly, in that desolate
spot, into each other—the dead and the living—were
alike in every particular, down to the smallest
detail; it was as though the living man gazed into
a mirror, which threw back every line, even every
faint touch of colouring, in his own face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy Chater!” whispered Crowdy to himself
in an awed voice. “So, I’ve found you at last!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />ON THE TRACK OF A SHADOW</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The man’s first impulse was to shout for assistance;
his second, to dash hot foot after the murderer;
his last, to keep perfectly still, while he
thought hard, with all his wits sharpened by the
crisis of the moment. For hours, he had been racing
across country, and hiding and dodging, in pursuit
of this man; and he came upon him lying dead, the
victim of he knew not what conspiracy. Instinctively
he glanced about him, with the dread of seeing
other murderous eyes watching; instinctively
sprang to his feet, the better to face whatever danger
might threaten.</p>

<p class='c009'>The thing was so awful, and so unexpected, that
the man, for a moment, had no power to face it;
indeed, he had started to run from the place, in an
agony of fear, when a sudden thought swept over
him—arresting his flight, and holding him as motionless
as though some mortal hand had gripped
him, and brought him to bay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy Chater dead!” he gasped. “This puts
a new light on things indeed! Dandy Chater dead—and
out of the way! Let me think; let me hammer
something out of this new horror—let me find
the best road to travel!” He sat down among the
rotting timbers, and propped his chin in his palms,
and stared at the dead man.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>“Who am I? Who—in all this amazing world,
will believe my story, if I tell it? Dandy Chater
out of the way!——My God!—that serves my
purpose; that was what I wanted. The game’s in
my hands; the likeness——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He started to his feet again, and looked round
wildly—looked round, like a hunted man who seeks
desperately for some way of escape; ran a few
paces, and stood listening; came slowly back again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great heavens!” he muttered softly—“they’ll
think I murdered him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was a sufficiently sobering thought; he stood
still, the better to work out the new problem which
faced him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think, Philip Crowdy: you’ve come across the
world, to find this man—to wrest from him that
which is your right. His real murderer is by this
time far away; you are alone with his body, in a
place to which you have tracked him. If Dandy
Chater has been lured here, and struck down, as is
more than likely in such a neighbourhood, for the
mere purpose of robbery, there is not the slightest
chance—or a very faint one, at best—of finding the
man who struck the blow. On the other hand—how
do you stand? Tell your story to the world,
and, if they believe it, what must inevitably be
said: that by this man’s death you benefit—therefore,
by logical reasoning, you must have compassed
his death. Philip Crowdy—you’re in a remarkably
tight place!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking at the matter from one standpoint and
another, he came to a desperate resolution—even
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>smiled grimly a little to himself, as he bent again
over the dead man. Turning the body over, he
found that Dandy Chater had been struck down
from behind, apparently with a heavy piece of timber
which lay near at hand; he must have been
wandering at the very edge of the river at the time,
for the rising tide was now actually lapping the
edges of his garments. Philip Crowdy bent above
him and began to search rapidly in the pockets, for
whatever they might contain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papers—watch and chain—keys—a very little
money,” he whispered to himself quickly, as he
made his search. “The money I’ll leave; some
river shark will get that; the rest I’ll take. The
keys I shall want—also the papers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Carefully stowing away the things in his own
pockets, he rose to his feet, and looked about him.
It was very late, and there seemed to be no sign of
life, either on land or water, save for the distant
muffled sound of the steady beat of a tug, working
heavily down stream.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t leave him here; for the body to be discovered
would spoil everything. And it wouldn’t
be particularly nice for Philip Crowdy to be discovered,
with Dandy Chater’s private possessions in
his pockets. Now—what’s to be done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The perplexing question was answered for him, in
an unexpected way. The beat of the tug sounded
nearer and louder, and he saw the gleam of the
light which hung from its funnel. Behind it, towering
high in the darkness, was a great vessel, which
it was dragging manfully down the river. While
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>the man stood there, idly and mechanically watching
it, with his dead likeness lying at his feet, there
came a sudden disturbance in the water; a great
wash from the river swamped up all about him, so
that he turned, and ran back hurriedly a few paces,
out of the way of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he looked again at the spot where he had
stood, the body was gone. Some of the timbers,
too, among which it had lain, were washing about,
and crashing together, at some little distance from
the shore. The man ran to the very edge of the
water, and strained his eyes eagerly, in search for
something else beside timbers; but the darkness
was too profound for him to see anything clearly;
and, although he ran along the muddy bank—first
to right, and then to left—he could discover nothing.
He stood alone, in that desolate place, and
the dead man was undoubtedly being hurried, with
the timbers among which he had fallen, down the
river towards the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently, the man seemed to realise the full
significance of what had happened; touched the
papers in his pocket; and stood staring thoughtfully
at the ground for a long time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is some strange fate in this,” he muttered
to himself. “To-night, by accident, I took the
place of the real Dandy Chater for a few hours;
now I’ll take his place—not by accident, but by design.
Dandy Chater is dead and gone! Yes—Dandy
Chater is dead—but long live Dandy
Chater!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words, the man turned quickly, hurried
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>up the alley way into the street, and set off as
rapidly as possible in the direction of London.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was so late, that all public vehicles had ceased
running, and the railway station was closed. He
did not care to excite attention, by chartering a cab
to take him to London, and he stood for some time
in one of the main streets—now almost deserted—wondering
what he should do. The appearance of
a small coffee-house, on the other side of the street,
with the announcement swinging outside that beds
were to be let there, attracted his attention; the
proprietor of it had already closed one half of the
double doors, and was standing outside, leaning
against the side of the window, and contemplating
the street, before retiring from the public eye for
the day. Philip Crowdy, after a moment’s hesitation,
crossed the street, and accosted the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I have a bed here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man looked him up and down for a moment
in silence; removed the pipe he was smoking from
his lips—blew a long stream of smoke into the air;
and finally ejaculated—“’Ave yer pick of the w’ole
bloomin’ lot, if yer like. It’s my private opinion
that there ain’t anybody a sleepin’ in beds these
times, ’cept me, an’ the missis, and the Queen, an’
a few of sich like nobs; leastways, they don’t come
my way. Walk in, guv’nor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Crowdy followed the man into the shop—a small
and very dingy-looking eating-house, fitted up with
boxes along each side. The sight of the boxes reminded
him that he had had nothing to eat for
many hours; discussing the matter with the proprietor
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>of the establishment, he found that he could
be supplied with a light meal within a short space
of time. Accordingly, he ordered it, and sat down
to await its coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>He picked up a stained newspaper, and tried to
read; but before his eyes, again and again, came
the image of the dead face, which had stared into
his that night. So much had happened—so much
that was wild and strange—within the past few
hours, that it all seemed like some horrible unruly
nightmare. Yet he knew that it was something
more than that; for his fingers touched the papers
in his pocket, and the watch that had belonged to
the dead man. For a moment, as his hands closed
upon them, a sweat of fear broke out upon his forehead,
and he glanced about him uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a desperate game,” he muttered. “If the
body should be found, and recognised—or if the
likeness be not so complete as I have thought—what
shall I say—what shall I do? Why—I don’t
even know what manner of man this Dandy Chater
was—or what were his habits, his companions, the
places to which he resorted; I know absolutely
nothing. Every step of the way I must grope in the
dark. And I may betray myself at any moment!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He dropped the paper from before his eyes, and
found, to his astonishment, and somewhat to his
discomfiture, that he was being steadily regarded,
by a man who sat at the other side of the table.
More than that, the man, having his back towards
the little inner room where the meal was being
prepared, nodded his head quickly, in a familiar
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>fashion, and bent forward, and whispered the following
astounding remark—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot—give the Count the slip—’ave yer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Crowdy’s position, at that moment, was
not an enviable one. He was utterly alone, in the
sense that, whatever battles lay before him, he had
to fight them as best he could, and dared not trust
any living soul; worse than all, he must fight them
in the dark, not knowing, when he took one step,
where the next might lead. Moreover, the man
before him was one of the most repulsive looking
ruffians it is possible to imagine—a man who, from
his appearance, might have been one of those unfortunates
described by the proprietor of the place
as never sleeping in a bed. His clothes, which had
once been black, were of a greenish hue, from long
exposure to the weather, and were fastened together,
in the more necessary places, by pins and
scraps of string. His face, long and thin and
cadaverous, had upon it, besides its native dirt, a
week’s growth of beard and moustache; his hair—thin
almost to baldness on the top—hung long
about his ears, and was rolled inwards at the ends,
in the fashion of some thirty years ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>Crowdy, after eyeing this man for a few moments
in silence, grunted something inaudible, and
took up the paper again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No offence, Dandy,” said the man, somewhat
more humbly, and in the same hoarse whisper as
before. “Seed yer outside—an’ came in arter yer.
Agin the rules—an’ well I knows it; but there
ain’t no one ’ere to twig us—is there?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>“Well—what of that?” asked the other, taking
his cue from the fellow’s humility. “Can’t you let
a man alone, even at this hour? What the devil
do you want now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be so ’asty, Dandy,” replied the man, in
an injured tone. “It ain’t for me ter say anyfink
agin the Count—’cos ’e’s your pal. But you’re
young at this game, Dandy, and the Count is a bit
too fly. If you wants a fren’, as ’ll <i>be</i> a fren’, don’t
fergit the Shady ’un—will yer?” This last very
insinuatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—so you’re the Shady ’un—are you?”
thought Crowdy. Aloud he said—“Thanks—I can
take care of myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—you wos always ’igh an’ mighty—you
wos,” replied the other, with a propitiatory smile.
“It ain’t fer me ter say anyfink agin the Count—on’y
’e’s a deep ’un, that’s all. An’ ’e’s got some new
move on; ’e was a stickin’ like wax to you to-night—yer
know ’e wos.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Crowdy caught his breath. Here, surely,
was some faint clue at last; for it was possible that
the man who had been “sticking like wax” to the
unfortunate Dandy Chater that night, might have
stuck to him to the very last, down by the river’s
muddy brink. Crowdy was breathlessly silent,
waiting for more; he left his meal untouched,
where it had been placed, and kept his eyes narrowly
on his neighbour.</p>

<p class='c009'>But that neighbour had evidently made up his
mind to say nothing more; after a pause, he shuffled
to his feet, and started to leave the place. As he
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>neared the door, however, he came back again, and
bent his face down to Crowdy’s ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say—yer won’t fergit Toosday—will yer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about it?” asked the other, as carelessly
as he could.</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’y—at the Watermen—o’ course,” whispered
the Shady ’un, in a surprised tone. “Ten thirty,
sharp. I suppose you’ll come wiv the Count—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose so,” replied Crowdy. “Good-night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Left alone, he thrust his plate aside, and sat
staring at the table, turning the business over in his
mind. In the first place, he had resolved to find
Dandy Chater’s murderer; on the other hand, if,
as was possible, the man spoken of as the Count had
anything to do with that murder, it would obviously
be impossible for Philip Crowdy to appear before
him; the fraud would be exposed at once. Again,
it was evident that the late Dandy Chater had
kept remarkably queer company; and that, moreover,
Philip Crowdy—as the new Dandy Chater—was
pledged to meet some members of that queer
company, on the following Tuesday, at half-past
ten, at the house known as The Three Watermen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So far—so good—or rather, bad,” he said slowly
to himself. “I’m Dandy Chater—for the present,
at least; if the man who struck the blow happens
to meet me, he’ll either die of fright, or denounce
me. For the present, I’ve got to be very careful;
I’ve very fortunately discovered one or two things
which may be useful. But how in the world am I
to know what Dandy Chater was doing, or meant
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>to do—or what people he knew, or didn’t know?
At all events, I must put a bold face on the matter,
and trust to luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not until he was undressing for the night,
in the shabby little room which had been assigned
to him over the coffee-house, that he remembered
the interview he had had with the girl, on the road
outside Bamberton. He stopped, and stood stock
still, with a puzzled face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The girl—Patience Miller! I’d clean forgotten
about her. Why, Dandy Chater was to have taken
her to London, and they were to be married to-morrow.
Now, Dandy Chater—or the real one, at
least—is at the bottom of the river. But where on
earth is the girl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He puzzled over it for some time, and finally,
finding sleep stealing over him, gave it up, with all
the other troublous matters connected with the
past few hours, and slept the sleep which comes
only to a man who is utterly worn out with fatigue
and excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>He slept late the next morning, and had time,
while he dressed, to consider what his future course
of action should be. In part, he had made up his
mind the previous night; had studied carefully the
dress and appearance of the dead man, with that
object—indefinite then, but clear and distinct now—of
taking his place. He felt now that the first
move in the game must be for him to get down to
Bamberton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one in England knows of my existence;
only one man, so far as I am aware, knows, beside
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>myself, of the death and disappearance of Dandy
Chater. There is no one to suspect; so far as I am
concerned, there is everything to gain, and but little
to lose. Therefore, Mr. Dandy Chater the Second,
you will go down into Essex.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Watchful and alert—ready to take up any faint
cue which might be offered him—suspicious of danger
on every hand, Philip Crowdy got back to London;
made some slight purchases, with a view to
changing his dress; and started for Chater Hall.
Arriving at the little railway station, he returned,
with grim satisfaction, the salutes and nods of
recognition which one and another bestowed upon
him; got into the fly—the only one the station
boasted—and was driven rapidly to his future
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a fine old house, standing in most picturesque
grounds—a place which bore the stamp
of having been in the same family for many generations.
Mr. Philip Crowdy rattled along the drive
which led to the house, with very mixed feelings,
and with a heart beating unpleasantly fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I need all the luck I’ve ever possessed, and all
the impudence with which nature has endowed me,”
he thought. “Why—I don’t even know my way
about my own house—shan’t know where to turn,
when I get inside, or what the servants’ names are.
And I wish I knew what sort of man Dandy
Chater was—whether he bullied, or was soft-spoken—swore,
or quoted Scripture.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The fly drew up, with a jerk, at the hall door,
which was already open. A young servant—a
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>pleasant-looking lad, of about twenty years of age,
in a sober brown livery, ran out quickly, with a forefinger
raised to his forehead, and opened the door
of the fly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Morning, sir,” said this individual, in a voice as
pleasant as his face. “Hoped you’d telegraph, sir,
and let me drive over for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Crowdy alighted slowly, looking keenly about
him. “I hadn’t time,” he said, gruffly—being convinced,
for some strange reason, that the late
Dandy Chater had been of a somewhat overbearing
disposition. He walked slowly up the steps, and
into Chater Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>There his troubles began; for, in the first place,
he did not even know his room—did not, as he had
already suggested, even know which way to turn.
In desperation, he laid his hand on the knob of the
first door he saw, and walked boldly in.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found himself in what was evidently the
dining-room. He turned, as he was passing through
the doorway, and beckoned to the young servant,
who had taken his hat and coat, and who was lingering
in the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, I want you,” he said. His quick eye,
roving round the room, had seen a pipe on the
mantelshelf, and a spirit stand on an ancient Sheraton
sideboard. “Get me a whiskey and soda, and
bring me those cigars—the last lot I had.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The servant placed the spirit stand at his master’s
elbow, and hurried away to complete the order.
Philip Crowdy leaned back in his chair, and laughed
softly, when he thought of how well he was carrying
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>the thing off. “I must be as natural as possible,”
he muttered. “That was a good move about
the cigars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The servant reëntered the room, bringing the
cigars, and a letter which he handed to Crowdy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brought this morning, sir, quite early,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Crowdy, after a moment’s hesitation,
broke the seal, and read the following astounding
note—</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Dearest Dandy</i>,</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>You shall have your answer, sooner even
than I promised. I do trust you; I do believe in
your capacity for the better things of which you have
spoken. I will marry you, when you like, and with
a glad heart. Come and see me to-morrow night,
and we can talk about it comfortably.</i></p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Yours loyally</i>,</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Margaret Barnshaw</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Philip Crowdy dismissed the servant, with a wave
of the hand, and sank into a chair helplessly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />BETTY SIGGS BECOMES ALARMED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Philip Crowdy felt, however, that there was
no time to waste in vain speculation; he had
plunged into a mad business, and it must be carried
through at all hazards. Moreover, the more he
came to think about it, the more the strong nature
of the man rose up, to assist him to confront his
difficulties. Essentially cool and calculating, he
saw his desperate position, and saw, too, how the
house of cards he was erecting might be fluttered
down at a breath. At the same time, with the
daring of a desperate man, he took the thing
quietly, and determined to advance step by step.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything seemed to be in his favour. In the
first place, there was evidently no suspicion, in the
mind of any one he had met yet, that he was not
the man he claimed to be—Dandy Chater; in the
second place, the young servant who had first
admitted him gave him the very clue he needed,
and at the very outset. Coming into the room,
immediately after Crowdy had finished reading the
letter, this man asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, sir—but Mrs. Dolman would like to
know whether Mr. Ogledon is coming down to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Crowdy gathered his wandering wits, and
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>faced the question. “Mrs. Dolman—that’ll be the
housekeeper,” he thought, rapidly. “But who the
devil is Mr. Ogledon?” After a moment’s pause,
he looked up, and said aloud—“Can’t say, I’m
sure. You’d better send Mrs. Dolman to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man went away, and the housekeeper
presently came bustling in. She was a trim, neat,
precise old lady, with a certain dignity of manner
belonging to her station. She inclined her head,
and folded her hands, and hoped that “Master
Dandy” was well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old servant—been in the family all her life,”
thought Crowdy. Aloud he said—“I really can’t
say, Mrs. Dolman, whether Mr. Ogledon will be here
to-day or not. By the way, Mrs. Dolman”—this,
as a brilliant idea struck him—“I think I shall
change my room—my bedroom, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The good woman raised her hands in astonishment.
“Change your room, Master Dandy! Why—I
never heard the like! What’s the matter with
the room, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—nothing the matter with it; only I want a
change; one gets tired of anything. Just come
upstairs with me, and I’ll show you what I
mean.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dolman would have stepped aside, in the
doorway, to allow him to precede her; but he waved
her forward impatiently, and she went on ahead,
and up the broad staircase, with her gown held up
delicately in two mittened hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” thought Philip Crowdy, with a chuckle,
“I shall know where I sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>The old lady went before him, and softly opened
the door of a room on the left hand—Crowdy
taking careful note of its position. It was a beautifully
furnished room, with huge old-fashioned
presses in it, and with everything arranged with a
view to comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There couldn’t be a better room, Master Dandy,”
urged the old lady—“and you’ve slept in it as long
almost as I can remember. There’s your dressing-room
opening out of it, and your bath-room beyond
that—nothing could be more convenient, Master
Dandy. If you moved into the Yellow room, the
outlook is pretty, it can’t be denied—but it ain’t
to be compared to this. Of course, Master Dandy,
you’ll do as you like—but I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Crowdy had achieved his object. He
looked round the room for a moment, and shrugged
his shoulders. “No—after all, I think you’re right.
It was only a whim of mine; I’ll stay here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he seemed disposed to remain in the room, the
housekeeper quietly took her departure, and closed
the door. Crowdy threw himself into an armchair,
and laughed softly. He felt that he was advancing
rapidly; every fresh pair of eyes which met his,
and in which he saw no gleam of suspicion, gave
him confidence. His one desire was to do everything
which the late Dandy Chater had been in the
habit of doing, and, on the other hand, to do nothing
which would seem strange or unusual. And
here again luck was with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dolman, on retiring from the room, had not
closed the door so carefully as she had imagined;
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>the sound of two voices, in low converse, came to
his ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s brought ’im ’ome in such a ’urry?”
asked the first voice—evidently that of a woman.
“I thought ’e was goin’ to be away about a
week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the second voice, which replied in the same
low tone, but somewhat aggressively, Crowdy
recognised that of the young man-servant, who had
already waited upon him. “Well—I suppose Master
can do as he likes—can’t he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’—some of us soon gits put out, don’t we,
Mr. ’Arry,” replied the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good. Now I know <i>his</i> name,” muttered
Crowdy to himself. Whistling loudly, he strode
across the room and pulled open the door abruptly.
The distant flutter of skirts announced that the
woman had taken fright and fled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry,” he said, turning back when he reached
the head of the stairs—“I’m going out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man seemed, he thought, to look at him
rather narrowly—almost frowningly, in fact. “To
the Chater Arms, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—I may look in there,” replied Crowdy
carelessly, and wondering somewhat at the evidently
well-known habits of the late Dandy Chater.
“I shall be back in time for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Philip Crowdy took his way downstairs,
selected a cigar with much care, and strolled out,
after taking a walking stick from its place in the
hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A dead man’s house—a dead man’s cigar—a
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>dead man’s walking stick!” he said to himself, as
he went down the long drive. “I don’t like it; it
smothers me. And yet—and yet——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not finish the sentence; some thought
was evidently running in his mind, to the exclusion
of everything else. He turned away from the village,
and made his way across some fields, and sat
down, in the winter sunlight, on the footstone of a
stile. Looking cautiously about him, he pulled
from his pocket the papers he had taken from the
body of Dandy Chater.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a cheque book, with one cheque filled
up, even to the signature, but still remaining in the
book. There was a pocketbook, with various entries
in regard to betting, and to sporting engagements
generally. And there were one or two letters,
in the same handwriting as that seen by him
that day. These last he read carefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were couched in terms of friendly advice,
and even of remonstrance—with sometimes a little
note of anger to be read between the lines. Yet
they breathed a very true and very disinterested
affection, and were, in every way, full of true
womanly feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—Margaret Barnshaw—(sometimes she signs
herself ‘Madge,’ I see)—that’s the lady who’s going
to marry me—which is more than I bargained for,
when I stepped into Dandy Chater’s shoes. Well,
I’ll go through these more carefully later on.
Now, as it’s evident that I am expected at the
Chater Arms, I’ll make my way there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did so; to the accompaniment of friendly
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>nods, and rustic curtesyings and salutations. But
at the Chater Arms he received a shock.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a bright little place—much better and
more cleanly kept than the house he had patronised
on the previous day. From its well sanded floors
to the black beams which crossed its ceilings, it
was a picture of comfort and prosperity. And,
seated behind the hospitable-looking bar, was the
neatest and trimmest landlady imaginable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet it was precisely this landlady—or the sight
of her—which gave Mr. Philip Crowdy such an unpleasant
shock. As he entered the door, and she
turned her head to look at him, he had but one
glance at her; yet that glance was sufficient to
sweep him back through many years, and across
many miles of land and sea. If the woman had risen
calmly and awfully from the grave, her appearance
could not have been more startling to the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlady, for her part, appeared to be
troubled in no such fashion by his appearance. She
nodded—somewhat curtly, he thought—and evidently
saw in him merely the idle Dandy Chater she
had been in the habit of seeing almost daily for
years past. Recognising the importance of keeping
a steady hand upon his emotions, Philip Crowdy
nodded in reply, and approached, and leaned over
the bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Afternoon, Master Dandy,” said the woman,
fixing her eyes again on her work. Yet how
familiar her voice was in his ears—and how he
longed to jump over the bar, and take her portly
person in his arms!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>“Good-afternoon,” he responded. “And I wonder,”
he thought—“what your name is now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long pause; and then, in sheer self-defence,
he ordered something to drink, adding, at
the same time—“It’s so deadly dull up at the Hall,
that I thought I’d look down to see you.” He
stopped lamely, wondering if she expected him to
say anything else.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very kind of yer, Master Dandy,” she retorted
quickly, flashing her black eyes at him for a moment,
as she set his glass before him. “Wouldn’t
yer like to step into the parlour, Master Dandy?”
she added. There was no graciousness about the
speech, and she was evidently in a bad humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks—I think I shall do very well here,”
replied Crowdy. “And, if you only knew, old
Betty, whose eyes are looking at that dear old grey
head of yours, at this moment, I think you’d jump
out of your skin.” This latter, it is scarcely necessary
to add, passed through his thoughts only, and
not his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently, to his astonishment, the old woman,
after making several false starts, got up quickly,
and came round the bar, and faced him; he saw
that there was some extraordinary excitement upon
her; he could hear one foot nervously beating the
ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy,” she said, in a voice little above
a whisper—“I must speak to you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the instant, the man felt that she had made
some discovery—that she knew he was not Dandy
Chater. But, the next moment, he saw that this
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>was a matter which had been consuming her for
some time, and had now boiled up, as it were, and
could be held no longer—some grievance which she
imagined she had against Dandy Chater. Knowing
that he had a part to play, he spoke lightly and
easily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—I’m here; speak to me, by all means,”
he said, with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not here—not here, Master Dandy,” she said,
hurriedly. “If you would be so kind as step in
here, there ain’t likely to be no one in this time
o’ the day, Master Dandy.” She indicated, as she
spoke, the door of the little parlour near at hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you will,” replied Crowdy; and he followed
her into the room, inwardly wondering what was
going to happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inside the room, he seated himself upon a table,
and looked questioningly at her. She was evidently
at a loss how to proceed, for a few moments,
and stood nervously beating her fingers on
the back of a chair. When, at last, she broke the
silence, her question was a startling one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy—for the love of God—where’s
Patience Miller?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man stared at her in amazement. He knew
the name in an instant—remembered the interview,
in the darkness and the rain, upon the road outside
the village—almost felt again, for an instant, the
warm pressure of the girl’s lips upon his. He shook
his head, in a dazed fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How on earth should I know?” he asked, slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How should anybody know better, Master
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>Dandy?” she retorted, in the same suppressed excited
voice. “Master Dandy—I’m an old woman,
and poor Patience, ’avin’ no mother of ’er own,
’as turned to me—natural-like—these many years.
There’s been w’ispers ’ere, an’ w’ispers there, this
ever so long; but it was only the other night as I
got it all from ’er.” The good woman was quivering
with excitement, and her fingers were beating
a rapid tattoo on the back of the chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All what?” asked Crowdy, faintly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ’ole story, Master Dandy,” she replied
promptly. “Ah—it ain’t no use your tryin’ to
deny it, sir; I knows the truth w’en I ’ears it—’specially
w’en it comes to me wi’ tears an’ sighs.
You’ve led ’er wrong, Master Dandy—you know
you ’ave; and now—wot’s become of ’er?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you I know nothing about the girl,” replied
Crowdy, doggedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman threw up her grey head, like a
war horse, and looked defiance at him. “Then,
Master Dandy,” she said fiercely—“if yer turn me
and old Toby out in the road, I’ve got to tell yer
a bit o’ my mind. You’re a Chater—and you’ve
got the Chater blood in you, I suppose—because I
knowed your blessed father and mother, now in
their graves. But there it ends; for you’ve got
some other black heart in you, that never belonged
to them. There’s not a man or woman, in the
countryside, but wot won’t shake their ’eads, w’en
they ’ears your name—an’ well you knows it. Oh—if
on’y my boy ’ad lived, wot a Chater ’e would
’ave been!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>For some hidden reason, the man seemed strangely
moved by that last despairing phrase from her lips;
indeed, as she bowed her old face down on her
hands, with a moan, he made a sudden movement,
with outstretched arms, as though he would have
taken her within them and comforted her. But
when, a moment afterwards, she looked up, with
the former stern expression settling on her features,
the man was simply watching her keenly, with his
hands thrust in his pockets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you talking about?” he asked, slowly.
“What about your boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hesitated for a moment, even glancing round
at the door behind her; then came a little nearer
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ain’t never said anything about it, Master
Dandy, because I thought the story was dead and
buried like my poor boy—an’ I didn’t think as ’ow
talkin’ about it would do anybody any good. But
it don’t matter now; an’ I’d like you to know, Master
Dandy, that for all your pride—your wicked
pride—you wouldn’t ’ave no right to be standin’
’ere, as the master of Chater ’All, if my poor boy
’ad lived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man was watching her, more keenly than
ever; for the sake of appearances, however, he let
a smile play round his mouth, and then broke into
a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—you may laugh, Master Dandy. Wot if I
tell you that you had a brother—an elder brother,
Master Dandy, though only by a matter of minutes.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>“What on earth are you talking about?” asked
the man; though only for the sake of appearances
again—for he had heard the story from her lips, a
long, long time before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The truth!” she exclaimed. “Not <i>one</i> child,
Master Dandy, came into the world at Chater Hall,
w’en you was born—but <i>two</i>—twins; an’ the other
boy was the first. But your father was crazy on
that one idea; I’d often ’eard ’im say that if ever
twins came, ’e would find means to git rid of one of
them. It was all done quiet and secret-like; ole
Cripps was doctor ’ere then—an’ a drunken little
rascal ’e was, though sound in ’is work. ’E’d ’ave
done anything for money—that man; an’ pretty
’eavy ’e must ’ave been paid by your father for it.
As for me—the Lord forgive me—I’d a notion of
starting at the other side of the world, and making
a business. So your father sent me off, with five
hundred pounds, and the eldest boy—the eldest, because
’e seemed the weakest. ‘I won’t ’ave two
boys, to fight over the property, an’ cut it up after
I’m dead an’ gone,’ says your father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—and what became of the boy?” asked
Crowdy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Went to Australia, ’e did, the blessed mite—an’
growed fine and strong—lookin’ on me as ’is mother,
an’ ’avin’ my name, as it was then—Crowdy; Philip
Crowdy, we called ’im. Then I met Siggs—my
Toby—an’ we ’adn’t been married a year, an’ I was
full of care an’ anxiety, over a little one o’ my own—w’en
Philip disappeared. ’E was ten then, an’ I
told ’im the story, on’y a week or two afore ’e went—your
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>father bein’ dead, an’ my lips sealed no
longer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A pretty story, Mrs. Siggs,” replied Philip.
“And you never heard anything about this boy
again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never,” she replied, sadly. “We did everyfink
we could to find ’im; but we was livin’ on the very
edge of the bush at that time, an’ the poor lad must
’ave got lost in it, an’ starved to death. Even men
’ave done that,” she added, with her apron at her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And why did you return to England?” he asked,
in the same dull level voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t abear the place, after we’d lost ’im;
an’ things went wrong, an’ Siggs an’ me lost most
of our money. Besides, I was always longin’
for the old place where I was born; an’ so at
last we come ’ome, without nobody bein’ a bit
the wiser, an’ took the Chater Arms—an’ settled
down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Carried away by the remembrances of years,
Betty Siggs had forgotten the real object with
which she had started the conversation; she remembered
it quickly now, and her tone changed.
But it was no longer harsh; the remembrance of
her boy, as she called him, had softened her, and
she turned to the graceless Dandy Chater—(as she
imagined him to be)—and spoke pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy, won’t you listen to an old woman—won’t
you tell me w’ere I can find this poor girl—Patience;
won’t you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Crowdy, remembering suddenly the part
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>he had to play, got up impatiently, and made for
the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you,” he said, with a frown, “that I know
nothing about her. And please let us hear no more
of such idle tales as these. Your boy, indeed!”
He laughed, and swung out of the place into the
road.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet, as he walked along, his heart was very sore,
and his face was troubled. “Poor old Betty!” he
muttered to himself—“she thinks I’m Dandy Chater—and
a blackguard; what would she think, if she
knew that the boy she lost in the bush was saved,
after all; and that he stands here to-day, in his
dead brother’s place, and under his dead brother’s
name? What would she say, if she knew that I am
her boy, as she calls me—Philip Crowdy—or Philip
Chater?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />A SUNDAY TO BE REMEMBERED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The sun, shining brightly over the trim lawns
which stretched before Chater Hall, seemed to declare,
deceitfully enough, the next morning, that
winter was dead and buried, and spring come in
full force to take its place. Philip Crowdy—or
Philip Chater, as we must now call him—waking
in the unaccustomed softnesses of a great bed, and
gradually opening his eyes upon the luxuries about
him, awoke as gradually to a remembrance of his
new position; looked at it lazily and comfortably,
as a man will who wakes from deep sleep; and then
came to a full realisation of all it meant, and sat up
quickly in bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” he muttered softly to himself, nodding
his head as he looked about him—“I am bound to
admit that when one has slept—or tried to sleep—for
a few weeks, in a narrow berth aboard an evil-smelling
sailing vessel, with a scarcity of blankets,
and no pillows worth mentioning, this”—he looked
round the big bed, and smiled—“this is a very decent
apology for Heaven. And—such being the
case—I want to stop in Paradise as long as possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stretched out his hand, and pulled the bell-rope.
In a moment or two, the young servant
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>Harry made his appearance—coming softly into the
room, and regarding his master with some surprise.
Philip Chater, quick to take his cue from the other’s
expression, glanced carelessly at Dandy Chater’s
watch, which hung near his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rather early, Harry? Yes—I know it is; but
I’m restless this morning. I shall get dressed at
once. Put me out some things—you know what I
want; I don’t want to be bothered about it—and
get my bath ready. Oh—by the way”—he called
out, as the young man was moving away—“I shall
go to church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The servant stopped, as though he had been shot—even
came back a pace or two towards the bed.
The expression of his face was such an astonished
one, that Philip knew that the day, from a point of
view of good luck, had begun very badly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Harry, with something
very like the flicker of a smile about his
mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said,” repeated Philip Chater, slowly and emphatically,
being determined to brave the matter
out—“that I should go to church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, sir.” The young man had recovered
his composure, and walked through into the adjoining
bath-room, after another quick glance at his
master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—Dandy Chater was evidently not a professing
Christian,” muttered Philip. “I’m half sorry
now that I suggested going; but I suppose it’s best
to take the bull by the horns, and plunge among
the people I shall have to meet as rapidly as possible.
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>Well, if they single me out as a lost sheep, and
call me publicly to repentance, I can’t help it. But
I shouldn’t be surprised if the living were in my
gift; in which case, they may be disposed to forgive
me, and treat me leniently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Finding, to his satisfaction, that the clothes belonging
to the late Dandy Chater fitted his successor
as accurately as though made for him, Philip
went down to breakfast in an improved frame of
mind. After breakfast, when he lounged out into
the grounds, there came another of those little trials
to his nerves, which he was destined thereafter often
to experience.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coming near to the stables, a dog—a fine animal
of the spaniel breed—leapt out suddenly, with
joyous barks, to meet him; came within a foot or
two—sniffed at him suspiciously—and then fled,
barking furiously. Turning, in some discomfiture,
he came almost face to face with the servant Harry,
who was looking at him, he thought, curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something the matter with that beast,” said
Philip, as carelessly as he could. “Have it chained
up.” Turning away, and reëntering the house, he
said softly to himself—“The moral of which is:
keep away from the animals. They are wiser than
the more superior beings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was with very uncomfortable sensations in his
breast that Philip Chater—after discovering, in his
wanderings, a small gate and path leading direct
from the grounds to the churchyard—strolled carelessly
across, and entered the church. He had been
careful to wait until the last moment, when the slow
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>bell had actually ceased, before venturing inside;
and it was perhaps as well that he did so. Fortunately
for himself, he came face to face, just inside
the porch, with an ancient man, who appeared to
act as a sort of verger or beadle; and who was so
much astonished at his appearance, and stepped so
hurriedly backwards, that he almost tripped himself
up in the folds of his rusty black gown. But he recovered
sufficiently to be able to shuffle along the
church, towards the pulpit, and to pull open the door
of a huge old-fashioned pew, like a small parlour,
with a fireplace in it. Philip was glad to hide himself
within the high walls of this pew, and to find
himself shut in by the ancient one.</p>

<p class='c009'>But his coming had created no little stir. Although,
having seated himself, he could see nothing
except the windows above him, and a few
cracked old monuments high up on the walls, he
was nevertheless aware of a rustling of garments,
and sharp whisperings near him. When, presently,
he rose from his seat with the rest of the congregation,
he discovered that his eyes, passing over the
top of the pew were on a level with certain other
eyes—gentle and simple—which were hurriedly
withdrawn on meeting his own. Moreover, immediately
on the opposite side of the aisle in which his
parlour-like pew was situated, was another pew, in
which stood a young girl—very neatly, but very
beautifully dressed; and, to his utter embarrassment,
the eyes of this young girl met his, with a
gaze so frank and kindly, and lingered in their
glance for a moment so tenderly and sweetly over
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>the top of that high pew, that he wondered who in
the world the young girl was, and what interest she
had in Dandy Chater.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again—another disquieting circumstance arose;
for, when he got to his feet a second time, and almost
instinctively looked again in the direction of
those eyes which had met his so frankly, his glance
fell on another pair, near at hand—a black pair,
looking at him, he thought with something of sullenness—something
of pleading. This second pair
of eyes were mischievous—daring—wilful—kittenish—what
you will; and they were lower than the
other eyes, showing that their wearer was not so
tall. And the strange thing about them was, that
they flashed a glance, every now and then, at the
other eyes—a glance which was one wholly of defiance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The devil’s i’ the kirk to-day,” thought Philip
Chater—“and I wish I knew what it was all about.
Dandy—my poor brother—you’re at the bottom of
the river; but you didn’t clear up things before you
went.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The clergyman was a dear old white-haired man,
who also gave a glance, of kindly sympathy and
encouragement, towards the big square pew and its
single occupant; and who preached, in a queer
quavering old voice, on love, and charity, and all
the sweeter things which men so stubbornly contrive
to miss. And he tottered down the steps from
the pulpit, with yet another glance at the big pew.</p>

<p class='c009'>The service ended, Philip Chater sat still—and, to
his infinite astonishment, every one else sat still too.
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>Worse than all, the whispering, and the faint stirring
of dresses and feet, began again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what on earth they’re waiting for,”
thought Philip, craning his neck, in an endeavour
to peer over the top of the pew. The next moment,
the door of the pew was softly opened, and the
ancient man who had ushered him into it, stood
bowing, and obviously waiting for him to come out.
In an instant, Philip recognised that the congregation
waited, in conformity with an old custom,
until the Squire should have passed out of
church.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rising, with his heart in his mouth, the supposed
Dandy Chater faced that small sea of eyes, every
one of which seemed to be turned in his direction;
and every face, instead of being, as it should have
been, familiar to him from his childhood, was the
face of an utter stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>He thought hard, while he gathered up Dandy
Chater’s hat and gloves—harder, probably, than he
had ever thought before, within the same short
space of time. And then, to crown it all, as he
stepped from the pew came the most astounding
event of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young girl with the kindly eyes looked full
at him, as he stepped into the aisle; hesitated a
moment; and then, with a quick blush sweeping up
over her face, rose to her full height—(and she was
taller than the average of women)—and stepped out
into the aisle beside him. Quite mechanically, and
scarcely knowing what he did, he offered her his
arm; and they passed slowly out of the church
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>together, with the silent congregation, still seated,
watching them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a word was spoken by either of them, until
they had almost crossed the churchyard; glancing
back over his shoulder, Philip could see the people
emerging from the porch, and breaking up into
groups, and evidently talking eagerly. And still
no word had been said between the two chief actors
in this amazing scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, the girl turned her face towards his, (she
had seemed quite content to walk on beside him, in
silence, until this moment) and spoke. Her voice,
the man thought, was as beautiful as her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Dandy dear—have you nothing to say
to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a flash, light broke in upon Philip Chater.
From the girl’s appearance, style of dress, and easy
assurance with him, in the presence of a church-full
of people he felt that this must be the Margaret
Barnshaw whose letter he had read—the letter in
which she promised to marry Dandy Chater. But,
not being sure even of that, or of anything indeed,
he decided to grope his way carefully; looking at
her with a smile, he asked lightly—“What would
you have me say to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She clasped her other hand on his arm, and her
face suddenly grew grave, and, as he thought, more
tender even than before; her voice, too, when she
spoke again, had sunk to a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing—not a word, dear boy,” she said.
“You’ve said it all so many times—haven’t you?
And I’ve sent you back, with a heartache—oh—ever
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>so many times. But—from to-day, we’ll
change all that; from to-day, we’ll begin afresh.
That’s why I took your arm, before them all, to-day—to
show them my right to walk beside you. Did
you understand that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no reasonable doubt now that this was
the Madge of the letter; unless the late Dandy
Chater had made proposals, of a like nature, in
other quarters. He answered diplomatically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—I think I understood that,” he said. “I—I
am very grateful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember,” she went on, “what you
said to me when last we met—when I told you you
should have your answer definitely? Do you remember
that; or have you forgotten it, like so many
other things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said so many things, that perhaps I may have
forgotten which one you refer to.” Philip Chater
felt rather proud of himself, after this speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You said—‘I’m going to be a stronger,
better fellow than I have ever been before; you
shall find me changed from to-night; you shall find
I’ll be a new man.’ Do you remember that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a trying moment; and, for the life of him,
Philip Chater found it difficult to keep his voice
quite steady, when he answered, after a pause—“Yes—I
remember.” For this girl, with her hands
locked on his arm, and with her eyes looking so
trustfully and confidingly into his, had heard those
words, of repentance, and hope, and well-meaning,
however lightly said, from the lips of a man she
would see no more, and who was now washing
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>about horribly, a disfigured thing, with the life
beaten out of it. And the man who stood beside
her, in his place—in his very clothes—was a fraud
and an impostor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you mean it, Dandy dear? Was it true?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He answered from his heart, and spoke the truth,
in that instance at least. “Yes—God knows it was
true,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had left the road, and had turned through
a gate into a little wood, which belonged, he supposed,
to his own estates. Here, quite suddenly,
she stopped, and held out both her hands to him.
Very gravely—and, it must be said, with a growing
anxiety which matched an expression in her own
eyes—he took the hands in his, and looked, as
steadily as he might, into her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy—my dear boy—as friends—as man and
woman—we have said some bitter things to each
other—have parted in anger, more than once. You
have been wild, I know—have made some blunders,
as we all must make them, in our poor journey
here on earth. But you have sworn to me that
those old tales, about you—you and Patience
Miller—forgive me; I promised never to mention
the subject again; but I must—I <i>must</i>—you
have told me that all that story was mere
malicious gossip. As Heaven is my witness, I believed
you then; but tell me once again. Tell me,”
she pleaded—“that no woman need hide her face
to-day, because of you; tell me that—reckless and
foolish as you may have been—no living creature
weeps to-day, because of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>He paused for a moment; a dozen new thoughts
and ideas seemed to dart through his mind. The
name she had mentioned had brought again to his
memory the scene with the girl, on the road outside
the village, on the night of his first visit to
Bamberton—the girl whom Dandy Chater was to
have married, and who failed, after all, to accompany
him to London. But, for all that, he had a
double reason for setting her doubts at rest, and
for speaking clearly and without fear. In the first
place, the man to whom the question referred was
dead, and beyond the reach of any earthly judgment;
in the second place, Philip Chater was, of
course, blameless in the matter. Therefore he said,
after that momentary pause—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed—no living creature weeps to-day on my
account, Madge”—he felt that he must attempt the
name, and was relieved to observe no start of surprise
on her part. “I have had your letter; I—I
wanted to thank you for it. I wish I could think
that I deserved——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, dear,” she broke in, hurriedly. “All
that is past and done with; haven’t I said that we
start from to-day afresh. Perhaps—who knows?”—she
laughed happily, and came a little nearer
to him—“perhaps I’ve helped to change you—to
make a new man of you. And I won’t believe a
word that any one says against you—never any
more!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a gesture that was all womanly, and all
beautiful, she leaned suddenly forward, and kissed
him on the lips. Then, as if half ashamed of what
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>she had done, she released her hands, and, with a
quick half-whispered—“Good-bye!”—sped away
from him through the wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater stood looking after her, for a few
moments, in a bewildered fashion; then, presently,
sat down on a bank, and let his head drop into his
hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—it’s horrible!” he groaned. “Here’s a
woman—one of the best in the world, I’ll be
sworn—holding my hands, and kissing my lying
lips, and swearing that she loves me, and will make
a new man of me; and the man she loves lies at
the bottom of the river. I thought this was to be
a mere question of money; a matter of ‘the king
is dead—long live the king!’ but when it comes to
lying steadily to a woman, it’s another business altogether.
Yet, what am I to do?” He sat up,
and stared hopelessly before him. “If I tell her
that her lover is dead, I break her heart, and endanger
my own neck; on the other hand, to keep
up this mad game requires more subtlety than I
possess, and the Devil’s own cheek. What a mighty
uncomfortable pair of shoes I’ve stepped into!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He heard a sudden rustling among the leaves
near at hand, and the next moment a girlish figure
sprang out, and confronted him. Raising his head
slowly, from the ground upwards, he saw, first of
all, a very trim little pair of shoes—a gay little
Sunday frock—a remarkably neat waist—and so
up to a mischievous face, shaded by a wide hat;
and in that face were set the pair of black eyes
which had looked at him in so audacious a manner
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>in church, and which were regarding him roguishly
enough now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Dandy Chater”—the voice of this girl of
about eighteen was imperious, and she was evidently
not a person to be trifled with—“I want to
know what you mean by it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The situation was becoming something more than
merely humorous. Philip Chater pushed back his
hat, and gazed at her in perplexity; and, indeed, it
must be admitted that, to be accosted in this fashion
by a young lady, of whose name he was entirely
ignorant, was enough to try the stoutest nerves.
However, remembering all that was at stake, and
seeing in this girl one of a very different stamp to
the woman from whom he had just parted, he
asked, with what carelessness he might—</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what’s the matter with <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl stamped her foot, and began to twist
the lace scarf she wore petulantly in her hands.
“As if you didn’t know!” she exclaimed, passionately.
“I’ve watched you, since you walked out of
church—and I know why you went <i>there</i>—for
the first time since you were christened, I should
think. Surely, you remember all you said to me
last week—when”—the little hands were very busy
with the lace scarf at this point—“when you kissed
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater rose hurriedly to his feet; advanced
to the girl, and took her by the shoulders. “Look
here, my dear,” he said—and his voice was really
very plaintive—“if I kissed you, I’m very sorry—I
mean—I ought not to have done it. In fact,
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>there are a lot of things I’ve done in the past—and
I’ve left them behind. You’re a very pretty
girl—and I’m quite sure you’re a good girl; but
you’d better not have anything more to do with
me. It’s only too evident that I’m a bad lot. I
think—in fact I’m quite sure—you’d better go
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned away, and walked further into the
wood. Looking back, after going a little way, he
saw her crouched down upon the ground, weeping
as if her heart would break. Hastily consigning
the late Dandy Chater’s love-affairs to a region
where cynics assert they have their birth, he retraced
his steps, and raised the girl from the
ground. She was very pretty, and seemed so much
a child that the man tenderly patted her shoulder,
in an endeavour to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There—don’t cry, little one. I know I’ve
been a brute—or, at least, I suppose I have; and
I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—you haven’t,” sobbed the girl. “And
please don’t mind me; you’d better go away; you’d
better not be seen with me. He’ll kill you, if he
finds us together—he said he would.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’ll kill me?” asked Philip, glancing round
involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry.” She was still sobbing, but he caught
the name distinctly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who the deuce is Harry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if you didn’t know! Why, Harry, of course—your
servant. And he’ll keep his word, too.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />AN HONEST SAILOR-MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Philip Chater sat over the fire late that
night, in a futile endeavour to see his new position
clearly, and to decide upon the best course of action
for him to adopt. Try as he would, however, the
thing resolved itself merely into this: that Dandy
Chater was dead, and that he (Philip), together
with possibly one other man, alone knew of his
death; that Philip Chater was accepted by every
one—even the most intimate—as the real Dandy;
that, in that capacity, he was already engaged to
be married—had left a girl crying in the wood,
that very day, whose name he did not know, but
who obviously regarded him with considerable
tenderness; and that there was, in addition, a certain
Patience Miller, whom he was to have married,
and who, up to the present, was not accounted
for in the least.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Altogether—a pretty state of affairs!” he
muttered to himself, as he sat brooding over the
fire. “Why, I don’t even know whether I’m rich
or poor, or in what my property consists; I may
meet Dandy Chater’s dearest friend to-morrow, and
cut him dead; and, equally on the same principle,
embrace my tailor, and hail him as a brother! I
can’t disclose my real identity, for the question
would naturally be asked—‘If you are not Dandy
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>Chater, where is he?’ and I should have to tell
them that he was dead—murdered—and I don’t
know by whom. No; there’s not the slightest
doubt that you are in a very tight place, Phil, my
boy, and your only chance is to go through with
the business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His thoughts strayed—and pleasantly, too—to
the girl of more than average height, with the eyes
that had looked so frankly into his own; he found
himself remembering, with something very like a
sentimental sigh, that she had held his hands, and
had kissed him on the lips; remembered, too, with
some indignation, that the man she supposed she
loved had arranged to take another woman to London,
on that very night of his death, and to marry
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The late Dandy Chater,” he said, softly—“twin-brother
of mine, in more than ordinary
meaning of the word—either you are a much maligned
man, or you were a most confounded rascal.
And it’s my pleasing duty to discover, by actual
experience, whether you were saint or sinner. And
I don’t like the job.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Inclination, no less than the actual necessity for
following out that part of the tangled skein of his
affairs, led his thoughts, on the following day, in
the direction of Madge Barnshaw. Yet, for an
engaged man, he was placed in a decidedly
awkward position, inasmuch as that he did not even
know where the lady lived. Having recourse to
her letter, he found it headed—“The Cottage,
Bamberton.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>“Now—where on earth is ‘The Cottage’ situated,”
muttered Philip to himself in perplexity, as
he surveyed the letter. “As a matter of fact, she
ought to have supplied me with a map, showing
exactly how far away it was, and the best method
of reaching it. Let me see; what shall I do? I
know; I must sound the individual who is thirsting
for my blood—Harry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Acting upon this resolution, he rang the bell, and
requested that the young man should be sent to
him. On his appearance, a brilliant idea struck
Philip Chater, and he said, airily—“I am going to
see Miss Barnshaw. I think I’ll drive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry, whose eyes had been respectfully cast in
the direction of the floor, gave a visible start, and
looked up in perplexity at his master. “Drive,
sir?” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an ass I am!” thought Philip. “She
probably lives within sight of this place; and the
man will think I’m mad.” Aloud he said—“No-no;
what on earth am I thinking about? I mean,
I’ll go for a drive—now; and call on Miss Barnshaw
this afternoon.” He got up, and crossed the
room restlessly; stopped, and spoke to the servant
over his shoulder—spoke at a venture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the way, Harry—I suppose you’ll be thinking
of getting married one of these days—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was so long a pause, that he looked round
in astonishment at the other man. Somewhat to his
discomfiture, the servant was gazing frowningly at
the carpet, and tracing out the pattern on it with
the point of his boot. Looking up at his master,
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>still with that frown upon his face, he said slowly—“Don’t
see as it matters, one way or another,
Master Dandy, to anybody but myself. I don’t see
any likelihood of it at present. What time might
you be ready to drive, Master Dandy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Very wisely, Philip decided to leave the matter
alone. It was in his mind—in the earnest desire
which filled him to do something to straighten out
one of the many tangled things Dandy Chater had
left behind him—to say something to this young
man, in reference to the love affair at which he only
guessed; but so many other matters claimed his
attention, and demanded to be straightened out,
that he decided to leave the thing alone for the
present. Therefore he said, somewhat abruptly—“Very
well; I have no wish to interfere. And,
after all, I shall not drive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry hesitated for a moment, as though he
would have said something more; but finally
turned, and left the room. In a few moments he
returned, however, and announced—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Vint to see you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Momentarily wondering whether this might not
be some one else who loved him, Philip requested
that the lady might be shown in; and there fluttered
into the room an elderly lady—small, and
thin, and dry-looking; indeed, she gave one the impression,
from her appearance, of having lain by
unused for a long time, so dusty was her aspect.
She had hair of no decided colour, and features of
no decided form; and her clothing—even her
gloves—were of a neutral tint, as though, from long
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>preservation, whatever of original colour they had
possessed had long since faded out of them. But,
with something of sprightliness, she came rapidly
up to Philip, and seized his hand in both her own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Mr. Chater—shall I, under the special
circumstances, say—my dear Mr. Dandy?——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear lady,” replied Philip, lightly—“say
what you will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How good of you!” she exclaimed, and squeezed
his hand once more. “The dear girl has but just
told me all about it; and I hurried over at once, to
offer my congratulations——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I wonder,” thought Philip—“which dear
girl she means?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For I felt that I must not lose a moment.
Madge has not confided in me, as she might have
done, and I have had to guess many things for myself.
But I must say, Mr. Dandy”—she shook a
rallying forefinger at him—“that you are the shyest
lover I have ever known.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed—I am very sorry—” he began; but she
checked him at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—we’ll forgive you; only I had been given
to understand that you were very different—that’s
all. However—that is not what I came to say.
Standing in the position I do, as regards Madge, I
feel that I must make some formal acknowledgment
of the matter. Therefore, I want you to dine
with us—let me see—to-morrow night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall be delighted,” replied Philip, mechanically.
“By the way—what is to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tuesday, of course,” she responded, with a little
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>laugh. “Ah—love’s young dream! I suppose all
days are alike to you—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mention of that day had brought to his mind
a certain appointment he had. He remembered the
hoarse whisper of the Shady ’un in his ear, in the
coffee-house in Woolwich—“Toosday-ten-thirty
sharp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid,” he said, slowly—“I’m afraid I can’t
manage to come to-morrow. I—I have to be in
London; a—a business appointment. I’m extremely
sorry. Could you—pray forgive the suggestion—could
you arrange for some other evening—or
could you bring—Madge—here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had quite set my heart on to-morrow,” said
the old woman, in an injured tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m dreadfully sorry,” replied Philip again.
“But I shall be coming in to see Madge, and we
can make arrangements. If you are going back
now,” he added, “please let me walk with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you—but I am going down to the village,”
she replied, as she backed towards the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was gone, before he could quite make up his
mind what to do or say; he watched her through
the window helplessly, as she walked away from
the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Done again!” he muttered, savagely. “I
thought I should be able to find out where the
cottage was. Well—I must trust to luck, I suppose;
I haven’t committed any very great errors
yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed possible, however, that he might commit
an error which would lead to his undoing, in
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>this matter of the appointment at “The Three
Watermen.” In the first place, if, as he suspected,
the man responsible for the death of Dandy Chater
was the man known as “the Count,” it would be
obviously impossible for Philip Chater to keep the
appointment. Yet, on the other hand, Philip was
determined to know more of the surroundings and
associates of the late Dandy Chater than he knew
already; indeed, to do so was absolutely necessary.
He had set his feet upon that road which was
plainly marked “Deception”; and, wheresoever it
might lead, there must be no turning back now.
As Dandy Chater he stood before them all; as
Dandy Chater he must stand while he lived, or
until the cheat was discovered. Philip Crowdy
was as dead as though he had never existed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s another man, too, with whom I am supposed
to be in company—Ogledon, I think the name
was; I wonder who <i>he</i> is? However, I’ll go to
London—and I’ll attend this meeting, if it be possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Early next morning saw him on his way to the
station—this time with some pomp and ceremony,
for he drove a smart dog-cart, and was attended by
Harry. The occupants of other vehicles, passing
him, were respectful or familiar, according to their
grade; and he answered all salutations discreetly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m beginning to like this,” he said, as he leant
back in the corner of a first-class carriage, and lit a
cigar. “I wish I knew how much money there was
in the bank, or what property I had generally; I
must make enquiries. At present, things are decidedly
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>pleasant—and there’s an element of danger
about the business that gives it a flavour.
There’s that girl, too—Madge; but I’m not sure
that I quite like that. I’ve taken a kiss from her
lips that was never meant for me; and yet”—he
shook his head over it, and sighed heavily—“I’m
very much afraid that I’m a little bit in love with
her; I know, at any rate, that I dread very much
seeing those eyes change from tenderness to contempt—from
kindness to reproach or scorn. Well—we
must hope for the best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cheerfully hoping for the best, he made his way
to Woolwich, as night was coming on, and headed
for the little public-house by the river. Being still
doubtful, however, what course to pursue, he paced
a little side street near at hand for some time, trying
to make up his mind whether to put in an appearance
at “The Three Watermen,” at the time
appointed, or not. He was so deep in his reflections,
that he failed to notice one or two lurking figures,
in the shadow of the houses, on the opposite side of
the way; until another figure—not by any means a
lurking one, but one which took up a great deal of
the pavement, with a rolling gait, and roared very
huskily a stave of a song as it came along—lurched
towards him; when, in an instant, the lurking
figures became very active.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two of them darted across the road, and bolted
in front of the rolling figure; another ran swiftly
behind, and embraced the singer with much tenderness
round the neck. Before Philip had had time
to take in the situation completely, the four figures
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>formed one struggling heap upon the pavement,
with the central one—the singer, but roaring out
quite another tune now—making lively play with
fists and feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater rushed in to the rescue; seized one
assailant—dragged him to his feet—preparatory to
immediately knocking him off them; and looked
round to see how the battle was progressing. The
man who had been attacked—and whose musical
tendencies were stronger, apparently, than any
alarm he might reasonably be expected to feel—had
collared one of his opponents round the neck, in return
for the delicate attention bestowed upon himself,
and was hammering away lustily at him, making
the blows keep time to the tune of “The Death
of Nelson,” the first bars of which he solemnly
chanted, while he performed his pleasing duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who had been so unexpectedly knocked
down had got to his feet, and, together with the
third member of the gang, had bolted away; presently
the stranger, tiring of his exercise, and having
got, perhaps, as far through the tune as memory
served him, released his victim’s head, although
still keeping a tight hold on his collar. Philip, being
close beside him when he did this, saw revealed,
in the features of this footpad of the streets, the
Shady ’un.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now—you bloomin’ pirate!” exclaimed the
musical one, shaking his man until it seemed as
though he must shake him altogether out of his
dilapidated clothes—“wot d’yer mean by runnin’ a
decent craft down like that, in strange waters—eh?
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>An’ to land a man like that, w’en ’e’s a bit water-logged—leastways,
we’ll call it water-logged, for the
sake of argyment. If it ’adn’t ’ave been for this
’ere gent, I don’t know—” Here the man, turning
for a moment towards Philip, stopped in amazement,
and almost let his victim go. The Shady ’un,
too, was regarding Philip curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look ’ere, Mr. Chater,” began the Shady ’un,
with a whine—“you’ll swear as ’ow I’m a ’ard
workin’ man, as just stepped forward for to ’elp
this gen’leman, as was set on by two thieves—won’t
yer, Mr. Chater?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ere—’old ’ard,” broke in the man who held
him. “Who the dooce are you a callin’ ‘Mr.
Chater’? I’d ’ave you know that this ’ere gent is
a mess-mate o’ mine—an’ ’is name ain’t Chater at
all; it’s Crowdy—good ole Phil Crowdy—if so be
as ’e’ll excuse the liberty I takes. You an’ yer
bloomin’ Chater! W’y—they’ll be a callin’ yer
the Dook o’ Wellin’ton nex’, Phil.” As he spoke,
he stretched out his disengaged hand, and grasped
that of Philip Chater.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip hurriedly interposed, when he saw that
the Shady ’un was about to speak. “It’s all right,
Captain,” he said; “I certainly know this man,
and there may have been a mistake. Don’t you
think—pray pardon the suggestion—that he’s had
a pretty good thumping, whether he deserved it or
not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—p’raps ’e ’as,” replied the Captain, somewhat
reluctantly. “But let me give you a word of
advice, my friend,” he added to the abject Shady ’un.
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>“W’en nex’ you tries to ’elp anybody, wot’s bein’
run over—or run through—by a couple of thieves,
don’t show your kindness of ’eart by a thumpin’
’im in the wes’kit; to a man o’ my figger, it <i>ain’t</i>
exactly a kindness. An’ don’t call gentlemen out
of their names—’cos you’ll find——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right, Captain,” interrupted Philip;
“this man knows me as Mr. Chater.” To the
Shady ’un, who had been that moment released, he
whispered quickly—“Get off as fast as you can—and
think yourself lucky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man needed no second bidding, and in a
moment Philip Chater and the man whom he had
addressed as the Captain were left standing alone
in the street. The Captain was a big, burly individual,
with a round good-tempered face, surrounded
by a fringe of dark whiskers; whatever temporary
exaltation he might have been labouring under, before
the attack upon him, he was now perfectly
sober, and looked at his friend with considerable
gravity, and with a slowly shaking head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My boy—far be it from the likes o’ me to interfere
with a mess-mate, or with ’is little fancies—but
I don’t like this ’ere sailin’ under false colours. I
did know a ’ighly respectable ole gal, wot called
’erself the Queen o’ Lambeth; but she lived in a
retirin’ way, in a lunatic asylum. W’y, if so be as
your name is Crowdy—w’y, I ask, call yourself by
such a common name as Chater?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t explain now,” said Philip, hurriedly.
“A number of strange things have happened, since
last I saw you. You mustn’t think badly of me,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>old friend; but, for the present, I <i>am</i> sailing under
false colours, and am known to all the world as
Chater. Moreover, I must impress upon you to
forget that you ever knew any one of the name of
Crowdy, or that he ever sailed with you, on board
the good ship ‘Camel,’ from Australia for England.
Come—forget all about me, for the present—and
tell me about yourself, and when you sail again.”
He glanced at his watch, as he spoke, and found
that it was exactly ten o’clock. “I have half an
hour to spare, Captain; where shall we go, for a
chat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’y—to tell the truth, I’m a cruisin’ in strange
waters, an’ ’ave lost my bearings a bit,” replied the
Captain, looking about him with a puzzled air. “If
so be as you knew of a place, where the grog wasn’t
watered over much, with a locker for a man to rest
’isself on, it might be better than the streets—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly, they set out together, to find a
house of refreshment; and presently came upon
one, in a quiet street, with a tiny bar—empty—round
a corner. Here they called for what the
Captain termed “a toothful,” and were soon deep
in conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t told me yet when you sail again,”
said Philip, when he had parried the other’s questions
as much as possible. “I suppose you’ll be
quite glad to get on board again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—not exactly,” replied the Captain—whose
name, by the way, was Peter Quist. “I’m a thinkin’
of givin’ it up altogether. Yer see—it’s this way,”
he added, confidentially. “I’ve put by a bit of
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>money, an’ I’m thinkin’ of settlin’ down ashore.
The sea’s been my business—an’ I want somethin’
else for my pleasure. I’m a thinkin’,” he went on
slowly, pulling meditatively at his whiskers—“I’m
a thinkin’ of goin’ in for the showman line, with a
dash of the circus. I was always fond of ’osses—an’
I believe as fat ladies and two-’eaded babbies is
profitable—always supposin’ as Mrs. Quist don’t
get spiteful about the fat ladies. I’m now a lookin’
out for anybody as ’as got a good second-’and circus
to dispose of, with a fat lady or two goin’ cheap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Philip, laughing, “I hope you’ll succeed.
But what brings you into this part of the
world?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I come down ’ere, to see a man I thought ’ad
got wot I wanted. I’ve put up at a nice little
place, down near the river; I was makin’ for it,
w’en I run foul of them land-sharks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What place is it?” asked Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr. Crowdy—leastways, I should say—Mr.
Chater—they calls it ‘The Three Watermen.’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />AT THE SIGN OF “THE THREE WATERMEN”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For a few moments Philip Chater sat gazing at
Peter Quist, as though he half suspected that the
man knew more than his guileless face proclaimed,
and that he was playing a joke upon him. Seeing,
however, that his friend appeared to be completely
in earnest, and that he had simply answered his
question as straightforwardly as it had been put,
he merely remarked, in a surprised tone—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—what takes you to ‘The Three Watermen’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was a cruisin’ about in these parts—bein’ near
the water, and so comin’ more nateral like—w’en
I turned in there for a toothful, an’ found they let
beds. Wantin’ a bed—(for man were not made to
sleep on the ’ard ground)—I took it. It looks over
the river, an’ is cheap—which is a consideration.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It suddenly occurred to Philip that he might well
make use of this man, to discover whether or not it
would be safe to venture into the place that night.
If, as the Shady ’un had suggested, he was expected
to arrive in company with the man known
as the Count, and if, further, that man knew anything
of the murder of the real Dandy Chater,
Philip’s position was precarious in the extreme;
indeed, safety only lay in the company of those
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>people who were ignorant of the death of his twin
brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, Quist,” he said, after a little hesitation—“I
want you to do me a favour. At this
same house where you have a lodging, a certain
man is likely to be, in whom I have an interest.
I can’t explain the full circumstances; but I am
playing a desperate game, for a large stake, and it
is essential that I should know whether this man is
there or not; at the same time, I do not wish him
to know—or, indeed, any one else—that I am making
enquiries. Will you—to oblige a friend, drop a
casual enquiry as to whether the Count is there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Quist stared at him, in open-mouthed astonishment.
“’Ere-’old ’ard, Phil, my boy; I’m
afraid the beds at that ’ouse will be a bit too expensive
for me. I thought it was a place w’ere a ordinary
sailor-man might get a cheap lodging; but
w’en it comes to a matter of counts——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—you needn’t be afraid,” replied Philip,
laughing. “The man I want is not, I suspect, a
count at all—I think it’s merely a nickname.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain shook his head, and looked at his
friend with a troubled countenance. “Phil, my
boy,” he said, “I’m very much afraid you’re a gettin’
into bad company. In the ordinary course o’
nature, I don’t mind a little scrap in the street, or
bein’ butted violent; but w’en you knows the lubber
I’d nabbed, an’ ’e knows you by another name—I
don’t like it. An’ now, ’ere’s another of ’em, also
under a wrong flag. No, Phil”—the Captain was
very emphatic about the matter—“I do not like it!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>“Very well,” said Philip, somewhat testily, “I
won’t trouble you. If I had not been acting quite
innocently in the matter, I would not have asked
you to do this for me. I have no doubt——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop—stop!” broke in the Captain. “I never
said I wouldn’t do it; I only expressed my opinion.
Peter Quist ain’t the man to go back on a mess-mate,
as you’ve found afore to-day. Trust in the
old firm, Phil, my boy, and if there’s a count anywheres
about Woolwich, I’ll lay ’im by the ’eels, as
soon as look.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater urged upon him, however, the necessity
for proceeding with caution; and, above all,
making his enquiries in as casual a fashion as possible.
It being now very near the time for keeping
the appointment, the Captain, accompanied by
Philip, set off on his quest; they parted near to
“The Three Watermen,” Philip remaining in the
shadow of an archway, to await the Captain’s return.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a very short space of time—although it seemed
long to the waiting man—Peter Quist hove in sight;
coming along in a very mysterious and cautious
manner, and keeping well within the shadow of the
houses. He dived into the archway, dragging Philip
with him; and there stood for some moments, in
the semi-darkness, breathing hard, and shaking his
head with much solemnity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” asked Philip, impatiently—“what news?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell yer wot it is, young man,” replied the Captain,
slowly—“you’ll be a gettin’ me into serious
trouble, you will—alonger yer counts and things.
I stepped into the bar, an’ I orders a drop of rum—just
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>to ease conversation a bit; an’ I ses—off-hand
like—‘’As the Count come in?’ The man was a
drawin’ the rum, and ’e ses, without lookin’ up—‘No—nobody
ain’t seen the Count for some days.’
Then ’e looks up—seems surprised—an’ ses—‘Who
wants to know?’ I tells ’im a pal o’ mine was
wishful to know about the Count. Well—Phil, my
boy—the man looks at me very ’ard; and presently
I see ’im a w’isperin’ to some one, wot ’ad slipped in
on the quiet—an’ a lookin’ at me. So I strolls out—careless
like—an’ I ’adn’t gone far, w’en I found
as I was bein’ followed—and by the bloke as called
you ‘Mr. Chater’ not an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What—the Shady ’un?” exclaimed Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shady or not, there ’e was; but I soon settled
’is business,” replied the Captain. “As ’e was a
sneakin’ past a little shop, with steps a leadin’
down into it, I turns round on a sudden, an’ lands
’im one on wot I may call the fore-’atch—an’ down
’e tumbles into that shop. In fact,” added the Captain,
with a fine air of carelessness—“the last I see
of ’im, ’e was on ’is back, an’ the female wot kep’
the shop was a layin’ into ’im proper with a broom,
an’ yellin’ ‘Fire!’ Accordingly, I left ’im, an’ cut
on ’ere, as ’ard as I could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a good fellow,” said Philip, gratefully.
“I must go on to ‘The Three Watermen’ at once,
and trust to luck to bring me safely out of it again.
If you will come on later, and take your lodging
there in the ordinary course, I shall be glad; I
might want to have such a friend near me. But,
should you see me there, don’t recognise me, or take
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>the faintest notice of me, unless I call upon you
to do so. Will you undertake to carry out my
wishes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Peter Quist, though evidently much disturbed
in mind, nodded slowly, in token that he
would do as he was asked; and Philip Chater set
out alone for “The Three Watermen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Guessing that the late Dandy Chater was probably
well acquainted with the house and its inmates,
Philip, for his own protection, determined to put on
a moody sullen demeanour, and to lounge at the bar
of the place until he was accosted by some one; he
felt that he could take his cue more readily, if
he led those who imagined they knew him to speak
first.</p>

<p class='c009'>In pursuance of this plan, he roughly pushed
open the door with his shoulder, and lounged into
the place—looking about him with an air that was
half insolent, half quarrelsome. Making his way to
the bar, he gave a curt nod to the man behind it,
and gruffly ordered some brandy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who presided there regarded him with
a sort of obsequious leer; and took the opportunity
to lean across the bar, and whisper huskily—“All
gone upstairs, Mr. Dandy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the devil do I care where they’ve gone?”
asked Philip, roughly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ll be expecting you, Mr. Dandy,” ventured
the man, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—let them wait till I choose to go,” said
Philip, in the same reckless manner. “I’ve been
looking for the Count.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>“And he ain’t come,” replied the man. “They
expected he’d come along with you. There’s something
big afoot”—the man leaned over the bar to
whisper this—“hadn’t you better go up and see
them, Mr. Dandy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As a matter of fact, that was precisely what
Philip Chater most desired to do; but, in the first
place, he did not know which way to turn, or where
to go; and, in the second, he had no intention of
presenting himself before whatever company might
be expecting Dandy Chater, in such a place as that,
unannounced and unprepared. Therefore, trusting
to the good-fortune which had not yet deserted
him, he waited to see if some event would not
occur, to prepare the way for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care what’s afoot,” he said; “I’ll finish
my brandy, and go when I choose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man—who appeared to be the landlord of
the house—advanced his face a little nearer, across
the bar, and spoke in a wheedling tone. “I’m
going up myself, Mr. Dandy,” he said, in a whisper;
“perhaps you’d like to come up with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—if you like,” replied Philip, carelessly;
although this was exactly what he wanted. He
felt that, from the tone the man had adopted, it
was evident that the late Dandy Chater had been a
difficult man to deal with. He determined to make
what capital he could out of that.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man—after calling gruffly to a draggled
female in the inner room to come and attend to the
bar—dived under the wooden flap in the counter,
and stood beside Philip. The latter slowly and
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>coolly drank his brandy, and even stopped to bite
the end from a cigar, and light it—looking frowningly
at the other, who stood waiting patiently at
the foot of some dark stairs for him; all this to give
himself time, and to carry out, as fully as possible,
that idea, of which he had somehow possessed himself,
that the late Dandy Chater had been a remarkably
disagreeable fellow, and that it was
necessary for his successor to keep up the character.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, having spun out the time as much as
possible, he lounged after his guide, up the stairs;
and was ushered by him, through a low doorway,
into a room which, from the appearance of the
single long projecting window, which took up
nearly all one side, evidently gave on to the river.
Round a table in this room, four men were seated,
with their elbows upon it, and their heads very
close together; the heads were turned, as the door
opened, and a murmur—apparently of relief and
recognition—broke simultaneously from the four
throats. Philip Chater, observing, in that momentary
glance, that they were all men of an inferior
type to himself, from the social standpoint, carried
off his entry with an air, and swaggered up to the
table—still with that heavy insolence of bearing,
which had seemed to have so good an effect upon
the landlord below.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” he said, taking a seat at the table, and
coolly blowing a cloud of smoke into the air—“what
do you want with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He noticed, as he spoke, that the man who had
guided him to the room appeared to have a direct
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>interest in whatever proceedings were afoot; inasmuch
as that he took a seat at the table, quite as a
matter of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s the Count?” abruptly asked one man—a
tall, sandy-haired fellow, with grey eyes far too
close together to make his countenance a pleasing
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very question I was going to ask you,”
replied Philip. “Do you suppose I’m the Count’s
keeper?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—he left here with you last week,” replied
the same man, in an injured tone. “We supposed
he’d been staying with you as usual.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you supposed something that didn’t
happen,” said Philip, in the same surly tone as before.
“I’ve seen nothing of him since—since that
night.” Then, a sudden thought occurring to him,
he added—“I left him—down by the river.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A shrill voice—piping, and thin, and unsteady—broke
in from the other end of the table. Its
owner was a little man, with a figure as thin and
shrunken and unsteady as his voice—a man with
no linen to speak of, who yet had whiskers, which
had once been fashionable, on either side of his
grimy face, and whose shaking hand affectionately
clasped a glass of spirits. “A split in the camp—eh?”
he squeaked out. “Ogledon and his cousin
had a row—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater was learning many things and
learning them quickly. If Ogledon—the man expected
at Chater Hall by the housekeeper—and the
man known as the Count were one and the same
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>person, and that person Dandy Chater’s—and his
own—cousin, what had they both to do with these
men, and why had both disappeared—the one murdered,
and the other missing?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold your tongue, Cripps,” exclaimed the man
who had spoken first. “The Count knows his own
business—and ours; I expect he’ll be here presently——”</p>

<p class='c009'>(“I sincerely hope he won’t,” thought Philip.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the meantime, if you’re sober enough,
Doctor”—this to the man he had addressed as
Cripps—“we’ll get to business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater pricked up his ears; he remembered,
at that moment, that Betty Siggs, in her
disclosure to him of the story of his own life, had
mentioned a certain drunken little doctor, of the
name of Cripps, who knew the secret of his birth,
and had been paid to keep it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll be glad to know, Dandy,” went on the
man, who appeared to act as a species of leader—“that
the business at Sheffield has turned up
trumps. We don’t mention names, even amongst
ourselves; but the haul was bigger than we anticipated.
The man behind the counter—you know
who I mean—gets a thousand for handing over the
flimsies; and gets it pretty easily, too, to my mind.
The rest is divided out between us, except for your
share and Ogledon’s. Here’s yours”—he handed a
packet across the table to Philip—“and perhaps, as
the Count hasn’t turned up, you’d better take his as
well. Here it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip took the two packets, inwardly wondering
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>what they contained, and thrust them into his
pocket, with a nod. As he did so he became aware
that three of the heads had drawn together, and
that whispers were passing amongst them, while
three pairs of eyes were glancing in his direction.
Quick to fear that some suspicion of his identity
might have come upon them, he watched them
covertly; while such phrases as—“The Count said
nothing about him”—“I suppose we’d better tell
him”—“He’ll know the country, at any rate”—and
the like, fell upon his attentive ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now—what the devil are you plotting there?”
he asked, angrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sandy-haired man raised his head, and spoke
hesitatingly. “Well, you see, Dandy, it’s a little
matter the Count mentioned last week—but he
didn’t say anything about you. He’s told off the
men for it—and it’s a matter of a few diamonds,
and only women to deal with. But the Count’s
particular about one of the women—a young one—coming
by no hurt. After all, it’s down your
way, and he must have meant you to know what
was going on. It’s for Friday, as soon after midnight
as may be. There’s Briggs here, and myself,
and Cripps, in case of accidents. He wrote the
address, and a rough plan, so that we might find it
without making enquiries. Here you are.” He
tossed across the table a folded piece of paper as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip’s hand had closed on the paper, and he
was in the very act of opening it, when a confused
sound of scuffling and angry voices came from outside
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>the door. Looking round quickly, with the
others, he saw the Shady ’un dart in—breathless
and panting—and make a hasty attempt to close
it; indeed, he got his back planted against it, while
some one outside was evidently striving hard to
burst it open, and pointed with a shaking hand at
Philip Chater.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Treachery—by God!” he gasped. “He’s put
the splits on us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man’s appearance, no less than his voice,
and the words he had uttered, were sufficient to
cause alarm. He was battered and bruised from
his two encounters with the Captain, and with the
woman into whose shop he had been so unceremoniously
thrust, while his clothing—such as it was—had
been almost torn from him, by his struggle
with the unknown person against whom he still
frantically held the door. At the very moment he
spoke, this unknown one, proving too much for
him, burst into the room, sweeping the Shady ’un
aside, and revealed himself as Captain Peter Quist,
without a hat, and in a great state of perspiration,
disorder, and excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finding himself unexpectedly in the presence of
half-a-dozen men—one of whom was Philip Chater—in
addition to his late assailant, the Captain stopped,
and looked round in some astonishment. At the
same time, the Shady ’un, in an agony of spite and
fear, backed away from him, and continued to gasp
out his indictment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seed ’em together all night, I ’ave. Dandy
sent ’im ’ere, a spy in’ out fer the Count—an’ I——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>Philip Chater did not care to risk waiting to give
any explanation to that company. In point of fact,
he feared the honest Captain more than any man
there; for he dreaded lest he should blurt out his
knowledge of a certain Philip Crowdy, who was
done with, and left behind in the past. Therefore,
edging quickly near to the Captain, while he still
kept his eyes on the other men, who had risen to
their feet, he whispered quickly—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make a bolt for it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There hung from the ceiling, over the table, a
single gas jet, with a naked light; Philip, with a
quick movement, snatched the ragged hat from the
head of the Shady ’un, who stood at his elbow, and
dashed it straight at the light; the room was in
darkness in a moment. He heard the men falling
about, and stumbling over the chairs, as he darted
through the doorway, and plunged down the stairs,
with the Captain almost in his arms—for that gentleman
had waited for him. The men were actually
on the stairs, when the two fugitives darted through
the bar, and into the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rightly guessing that no attempt would be made
to pursue them in the open street, Philip and his
companion, after doubling round one or two corners,
came to a halt, and sat down on some steps
outside a church, to review their position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This comes of gettin’ into bad company, Phil,”
said the Captain drearily, when he had recovered
his breath. “A ’at—bought off a Jew gentleman,
with nice manners, only last week; a brush and
comb—the brush a bit bald, and the comb wantin’
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>a noo set of teeth; to say nothink of a night garment,
’emmed by the Missis, and marked with a
anchor on the boosum—all lost at ‘The Three
Watermen.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very sorry,” replied Philip, “but I think
we got off pretty cheaply as it was. But I don’t
think we had better be seen in company; those
fellows only saw you for a moment, and will
scarcely be likely to recognise you, should you meet
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want to meet ’em,” said the Captain.
“I saw that Shady chap in the bar, and thought ’e
was on the lookout for me again—so I chivvied of
’im upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They parted for the time, after Philip Chater had
impressed his address upon the Captain’s mind,
with many injunctions to talk about him as little as
possible. Philip, after walking for nearly an hour,
found a quiet hotel, and gladly got to bed. At the
last moment, before his eyes closed, he remembered
the two packets which had been given him, together
with the piece of paper the sandy-haired
man had tossed to him, and which latter he had
thrust into his pocket. He jumped out of bed, re-lit
the gas, and took them from the pockets of his
clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first packet, when he broke it, he found contained
bank-notes—for small and large amounts—to
the total of three thousand five hundred pounds;
the second packet held the same amount. Dropping
these hastily, he caught up the scrap of paper,
and hurriedly unfolded it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>It was a roughly-drawn plan of certain roads and
paths, together with two little squares—one at the
top right-hand corner, and one at the top left-hand
corner. The square at the right was marked—“Dandy’s
house—easily seen from village street.”
The other square was marked—“The Cottage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the address pencilled upon it was—“The
Cottage, Bamberton.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />MASTER AND SERVANT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For a long time, Philip Chater sat staring, in a
stupefied fashion, at the packets of bank-notes, and
at the paper he held in his hand. He was at first
utterly at a loss to understand why such a sum of
money should have been paid into his hands, together
with a similar sum for the mysterious man,
his cousin, known as the Count. Gradually, however,
a light began to dawn upon him; remembering
the talk about diamonds, and about the young
girl who was to receive no hurt, the horrible business
began to piece itself together in his mind, bit
by bit. Once again he seemed to be looking into
the evil faces, in that upstairs room in the low public-house
at Woolwich; saw that the giving of the
packets—one for himself, and one for his cousin—had
been but a dividing of the spoils of some successful
robbery. More than that, the paper seemed
to point to the fact that another robbery was
planned, at the house of Madge Barnshaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything seemed to point to this. The affair
had evidently been arranged by this same mysterious
man Ogledon; and that he was a frequent
visitor to Bamberton was obvious, from the mention
made of him by Mrs. Dolman, the housekeeper,
on the day of Philip’s first journey to Chater Hall.
Again, the mention of the young girl who was not
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>to be hurt—of the fact that they only expected to
have to deal with women—all pointed to robbery,
to which possible violence was attached.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My God!” whispered Philip to himself, in an
awed voice—“I’ve landed straight into the midst
of some tremendous conspiracy. Dandy Chater—the
Squire—the gentleman; yet Dandy Chater, the
associate of thieves and footpads. Dandy Chater,
professing love for the sweetest woman in the
world, yet mixed up with scoundrels who are plotting
to rob her! And, in the meantime, where in
the world is this precious cousin of mine—Ogledon?
Did Dandy Chater meet his death at that man’s
hands, and is that the reason the fellow keeps out
of sight? Well—two things are clear; in the first
place, I have in my possession notes, which I believe
to be stolen, to the extent of seven thousand
pounds; and, in the second place, the gang from
whom I escaped to-night are to plunder Madge’s
house, on Friday next, soon after midnight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He began to pace up and down the room, in an
agitated fashion; stopped suddenly, with a look of
resolution on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—one thing is clear; I must find the rightful
owners of this money, and restore it——Great
Heavens—I can’t do that! This plunder belongs
to Dandy Chater, and he belongs to the gang that
stole it—and I—I’m Dandy Chater! Upon my
word, I begin to wish that the good ship ‘Camel’
had struck a rock, somewhere on its voyage home
from Australia, and had deposited me comfortably
at the bottom of the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>Fully understanding the hopelessness of attempting
to do anything, at all events at that time, Philip
Chater put the notes under his pillow, and returned
the slip of paper to his pocket. He had lain down
in bed, with the full intention of putting off all
thought until the morrow, when a remembrance of
this same scrap of paper brought him suddenly upright
in bed, in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove!” he exclaimed, softly—“I shall be
able to find my way to the cottage easily enough,
after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He slept soundly through the night, and, quite
early in the morning, set off for Bamberton—sending
a telegram to “Harry—care of Dandy Chater,
Esq., Bamberton,” to apprise that respectable young
man-servant of the hour at which he desired to be
met at the station.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s another of the defects of my position,”
he thought, savagely; “I don’t even know the
name—the surname, at least—of my own servant.
However, if there should happen to be more than
one Harry at Chater Hall, I can blame it on the
post office, and swear they left out the name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To his satisfaction, however, the Harry he wanted
was awaiting his arrival at the little railway station,
with the smart dog-cart in which he had driven before.
But, ever on the watch for some sign of suspicion
in those about him, Philip Chater noted,
with a quick eye, that the pleasant manner of this
young servant was gone; that he answered his
master’s greeting, by merely touching his hat, and
without a word in reply. More than that, he
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>seemed to avoid Philip’s eyes as much as possible—glancing
at him covertly, and, as it appeared, almost
with aversion.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they drove in the direction of Bamberton—Philip
having the reins, and the young man sitting
silently beside him—Philip broke an uncomfortable
pause, by asking abruptly—“Anything happened
since I went to town?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For quite a long moment, Harry did not reply;
Philip Chater, looking round at him quickly, saw
that he was staring straight in front of him, down
the long road before them, and that his face was
rather white. “No, sir,” he replied at last—“nothing
has happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His manner was so strange—so perturbed, in fact,
for his voice shook a little as he spoke—that Philip,
scenting danger, guessed that something was wrong,
and determined to get out of him what it was, while
they were alone together. He turned quickly on
the young man, checking the horse’s speed as he
did so, and spoke quietly, though with a certain
strong determination in his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Harry—something <i>has</i> happened; I am
convinced of it. You are hiding something from
me; what is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another long pause, while the horse paced slowly
along the road, and the hearts of both men beat
faster than ordinary. At last, the servant spoke—still
without looking at his master. He spoke
doggedly, and as though repeating something he
had trained himself, with difficulty, to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s nothing I’m hiding, Master Dandy,” he
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>said, slowly and distinctly—“and nothing has happened—since
you went away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was evident that nothing was to be got out of
him; Philip touched the horse smartly with the
whip, causing it to break into its former rapid pace,
and said quietly, with something of reproach in his
tone—“You <i>are</i> hiding something, Harry. I am
sorry; I thought you were my friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God knows I am, Master Dandy!” broke from
the other, almost with a groan. But he said nothing
more, and they swept up the long drive to
Chater Hall in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, the ill-luck which seemed to have begun to
pursue Philip Chater, caused time to hang heavily
upon his hands that afternoon, and prompted him
to stroll down to the Chater Arms. Truth to tell,
he had a very strong desire to pay a visit to Madge
Barnshaw—which would have been easy, now that
the plan on the scrap of paper was in his hands.
But he hesitated, for more reasons than one.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place the natural chivalry of the man
rebelled against the thought of taking advantage of
the fraud he was compelled to practice upon an innocent
woman. Some feeling, stronger than mere
interest in her, had begun to stir in his breast, from
the time when she had placed her hand upon his
arm, in the church, until she had blushingly kissed
his lips, and fled from him. For this man, so
strangely made in the likeness of the dead, and so
strangely placed, in the masquerading game he was
forced to play, was desperately and bitterly lonely.
Surrounded by unknown dangers—necessarily suspicious
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>of every one with whom he came in contact—resenting,
as an honest man, the lie he was obliged
to live—he craved most earnestly for some sympathy
and tenderness. All unconsciously, this woman had
given them both to him; and, in the midst even of
his remorse that he should be playing so false a
game with her, was the natural selfish feeling of
his manhood, which cried out—“Let her love me;
she will never understand; I am as good, or better,
than the man to whom she thinks she is giving her
caresses. Born of the same mother, in the same
hour, and fashioned so strangely alike—he, the
younger, has had all the luxury and beauty of life
hitherto; I—the elder—all its hardships and privations.
Surely it is my turn—rightfully—now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, he thrust that thought from him,
and resolved to see no more of her than was consistent
with the keeping up of the fictitious character
he had assumed. And thus it was that, in desperation,
and haunted by troublesome thoughts, he
betook himself to the Chater Arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment he entered the door of that respectable
inn, he regretted having done so; for, behind
the neat little bar, there sat, to his infinite surprise,
the young girl whose black eyes had looked at him
so reproachfully in church, and whom he had left
weeping in the wood. However, he felt that he
must make the best of it; and he therefore advanced,
boldly and smilingly, and gave her greeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl was evidently disturbed in her mind by
his appearance—yet not unhappily so; she blushed
prettily, and rose, with some nervousness, to fulfil
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>his demands. And, just at the moment when, as
she was bending to pour out the liquor he had ordered,
and, as he lounged on the bar, his own head
was necessarily somewhat close to hers, the door
swung open, and Harry came in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The situation was, of course, ridiculous; for,
whatever the methods of the late Dandy Chater
might have been, Philip had a natural personal objection
to drinking in public with his own servant.
But, however he might have been disposed to resent
it, the sight of the young man’s face gave him
pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>It had been white when they drove together in
the dog-cart; it was white now—but with a different
sort of whiteness. Then, his face had borne the
expression of deep emotion—of a struggle to repress
something—almost of a deadly fear; now, it was
set into a look of stern and ill-suppressed anger.
Moreover, he made no attempt to give his master
any salutation, respectful or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Desiring, at least for the sake of appearances, to
assert his position, and being, at the same time, unwilling
to wound the lad more than could be avoided,
Philip stepped quietly up to him, and, with his back
towards the girl, said, in a low voice—“I don’t desire
that you should be seen here, at this hour of the
day. When your duties at the Hall are ended, you
can, of course, please yourself—but I can’t have you
drinking here now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The once respectful Harry looked at him steadily
for a moment, and returned a remarkable answer—speaking
in the same suppressed voice as his master.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>“I’ll please myself now, Master Dandy—and I’m
not drinking. I’m here for a purpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The nature of the elder man was too strong to be
put off, even with such a rebuff as this; his manner
changed, and his voice, when he spoke again, had in
it the sternness of command.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You forget yourself,” he said; “return at once
to the Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man, without changing his attitude in
the least, shook his head doggedly. “No, Master
Dandy,” he replied—“I’m going to stay here.”
His eyes wandered, for a moment, towards the girl
with the black eyes behind the little bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good. Then you understand that you
leave my service from this hour. Is that clear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Master Dandy—it ain’t clear. I don’t leave
your service—now, most of all—not if you was to
kick me, like a dog, from your doors.” He spoke
in a hurried, breathless whisper, and, to the utter
bewilderment and amazement of Philip Chater, his
eyes—full of some mute appeal—had tears in
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Baffled in earnest now, Philip Chater, after looking
at Harry for a moment or two in perplexity,
shrugged his shoulders, and turned away. But he
had no stomach for the drink the girl had prepared
for him; avoiding her eyes, he paid for it, and, without
looking at either of them, walked out of the
place.</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt that some mystery was brooding, behind
the extraordinary attitude of his young servant.
Remembering the girl’s mention of him in the wood,
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>he felt that mere foolish jealousy was at the bottom
of the matter; and, knowing that this was one of
the difficult legacies left behind by the late Dandy
Chater, he accepted it philosophically. At the same
time, he was puzzled at the young man’s last remark,
and at the evident emotion he had displayed.
Being in no mood to return to his solitary home,
which seemed always full of unfamiliar ghosts of
people he had never known, he struck off across
some fields, and sat down on the felled trunk of a
tree, and was soon lost in unprofitable dreaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was roused from this, by hearing a footstep
quite close to him; looking up, he saw the man
from whom he had so recently parted. Anger at
the thought of being followed, and spied upon,
brought him hurriedly to his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you want? What right have you to
follow me, in this fashion? I suppose you’ve come
to plead something, in extenuation of your rudeness—eh?”
he exclaimed. “I’ll hear nothing—I’ve
nothing to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned away angrily, and walked a half-dozen
paces; twisted on his heel, and came back again.
Harry had not moved; he stood, with his hands
clasped tightly together before him, and with his
head bowed on his breast. When he spoke, his
voice was low, and had a curious mournful ring
in it, that struck upon his listener’s heart like a
knell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy—I’m only a common country
lad, that’s seen nothing of the great world, and
knows but little of the rights or wrongs of things,
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>more than whatever good God put in my heart can
teach me. But I’ve only known one life, Master
Dandy—and that’s you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took a half step forward, and stretched out
his clasped hands, in mute appeal—dropping them
again the next moment. Philip Chater—humbled
and awed by the pathetic dignity of the lad—was
silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first thing I remember, Master Dandy, was
having you pointed out to me, on your pony, as the
young Squire; I used to go out of my way, to
watch you cantering along the roads. Then, afterwards,
when you took notice of me, and wouldn’t
have any one else near you, and made me your servant,
I was prouder than I can ever express. God
forgive me—(but there’s no blasphemy in it, Master
Dandy)—you were my God to me—my everything!
I think I would have been glad to let you
thrash me, as you did your dogs, if I could have
thought it would please you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater found his voice at last—although
it was rather an unsteady one. “Well,” he said,
with what brusqueness he could muster—“what
has all this to do with the matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy,” went on the appealing voice—“I’m
not a great gentleman, like you—and I can’t
put my poor thoughts into the right words. But—Master
Dandy—won’t you—won’t you try to run
straight with me—won’t you let me help you?
Master Dandy”—he came a step nearer, in his
eagerness—“I’d give—I’d give my life for you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—and yet you’ll insult me, because I happen
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>to look at some girl in whom you take an interest,”
said Philip, slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lad’s figure stiffened, and the appeal died out
of his eyes. “Because I love her, Master Dandy,”
he said. “Because I’ve got the feelings of a man,
and I know that a gentleman like yourself doesn’t
pay court to a tavern-keeper’s daughter, with any
good intent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—what the devil do you mean?” cried
Philip, startled for the moment into answering out
of his own honest heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy—I’ve stuck up for you through
thick and thin—and I’d kill the man who dared to
say a word against you. But you know what has
been said, about these parts—God forgive me, I’m
speaking as man to man, and not as servant to
master—and you know that decent mothers warn
their girls about you. Master Dandy—I suppose
these are gentlemen’s ways—at least, I’ve heard so;
and I’d have held my tongue, and done my duty, if
so be you had not touched what belonged to me.
But she’s mine, Master Dandy—and she’s a child—and
innocent. God in Heaven, man!”—all social
distinctions seemed to be swept away, for the moment,
in the passion which overwhelmed him—“was
not one forlorn woman’s life enough for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Staggered by the words, and even more by the
tone in which they were uttered, Philip Chater
turned upon him swiftly, and caught his arm.
“What do you mean? ‘One forlorn woman’s life!’
What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the passion had faded from the face of the
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>other man; but the eyes which looked into those of
Philip Chater had a horrible deadly fear growing in
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy—before God, I think I’m the
only man who knows it. There is time for you to
get away—to hide beyond seas—never to come back
to this place, where you have been led to do such
wrong. Master Dandy!”—he had fallen upon his
knees, at the feet of the other man, and was clasping
his dress, in the agony of his appeal—“I knew
you when you were a bright faced lad, laughing in
the sunshine, and with no stain of blood upon you.
Master Dandy——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stain of blood!” cried Philip, recoiling.
“What are you talking of? What madness
possesses you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No madness, Master Dandy—would to Heaven
it might be!” cried the other. “It isn’t for me to
see into a gentleman’s heart, or to know what
temptations he may have, above such as I am. But
the thing is done, and all high Heaven can’t undo
it now. Master Dandy—there is yet time to get
away, before they find it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you tell me what you mean?” cried Philip,
distractedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry got up from his knees, and came nearer to
his master—looking all about him fearfully first, as
though afraid there might be listeners, even in that
spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen, Master Dandy,” he whispered. “Last
night—restless, and thinking of you—for you
haven’t been as kind to me lately as you once were,
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>Master Dandy—I crept out of the house, and went
out in the moonlight. I walked a long way, without
knowing it—and I came to the wood behind
the old mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Like an echo, there came to Philip Chater certain
words, spoken by a girl who called herself
Patience Miller, and who had met him on the night
of his arrival at Bamberton. As in a dream, too,
while the other man went on speaking, he seemed
to see a figure dart out into the highway—a figure
that afterwards scraped heavy clay from its boots,
in the light of a flickering lamp—a figure which
now lay at the bottom of the Thames.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy,” went on the agitated voice—“I
came, by accident, to where she lay, with blood
upon her—dead—in the moonlight. Master Dandy”—he
put his hands before his face, and shuddered—“say
it isn’t true, Master Dandy—for God’s sake,
say it isn’t true!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked Philip, hoarsely,
with an awful sweat of fear beginning to break out
upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy—in the wood behind the mill—Patience
Miller—murdered!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a cry, the lad fell at his feet, and buried
his face in the grass.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />TELLS OF SOMETHING HIDDEN IN THE WOOD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Philip Chater was so stunned, in the first
shock of the thing, that he did not know what to
say, or what to do. Standing, as he did, an absolutely
innocent man, he yet had time to recognise
that he had taken upon himself the identity of another;
and stood answerable, by reason of that, for
that other’s sins, in the eyes of the world, at least.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had no doubt, in his own mind, that Dandy
Chater had murdered this unfortunate girl. Her
words to himself, on the night of his coming to
Bamberton—her reminder, to the supposed Dandy
Chater, of his promise to marry her—the mysterious
appointment made, for that same night, in the
wood behind the mill; all these things seemed to
point to but one conclusion. Again, the man running,
as for his life, to catch the train—and without
the girl; her disappearance, from that hour;
all these things, too, pointed, with unerring finger,
to the common sordid story, ending, in an hour of
desperation, in the blow which should rid the man
of his burden.</p>

<p class='c009'>These thoughts flashed rapidly through his mind,
even in the few seconds which elapsed after the
other man’s halting declaration, and while that
other man still crouched at his feet. Then, the
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>instinct of self-preservation—the desire, and the
necessity, to hide that blood-stained thing, which
seemed to point to him—innocent though he was—as
surely in death as it would have pointed in
life—swept over him. He caught the lad by the
arm, and dragged him to his feet; the while his
mind was fiercely working, in a wild attempt to
settle some plan of action. Even in that hour of
danger, a keen remembrance of the part he still
had to play was full upon him; in his brutal roughness
of voice, when he spoke, he played that part
of Dandy Chater, as he imagined Dandy Chater
would have played it himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get up, you fool!” he cried, roughly. “Is this
a time to be snivelling here? Suppose she is dead—it
was an accident.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry sadly but doggedly shook his head. “You
won’t find many to believe that, Master Dandy,”
he said. “She lies there—stabbed in the breast.
There is a trail of blood for some yards; she must
have tried to crawl away—and have bled to death.
Master Dandy, can’t you see that she will be found;
can’t you guess what they will say, and whom they
will question first? All the village has linked your
names, for months past.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She—it must be hidden,” whispered Philip,
weakly. “God—man”—he cried, with a sudden
burst of petulant anger—“why do you stand staring
like that? It may be found at any moment;
it may have been found before this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no help for it, Master Dandy,” replied
the other, with a groan—“it must be found, sooner
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>or later. I tell you, you must get away—beyond
seas, if possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And draw suspicion on myself at once!” exclaimed
Philip. Then, some of the real Philip
Chater coming to the surface, and sweeping aside
the false personality under which he lived, he
added, hurriedly—“But you must have nothing to
do with it, Harry; we mustn’t get you into trouble.
No—I’ll take the thing in my own hands, and in
my own fashion. Do you keep a silent tongue to
every one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not fear that I shall speak, Master
Dandy,” replied the lad. “And it may not be so
bad, after all; you may yet find a way of getting
out of it, Master Dandy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A way of getting out of it!” muttered Philip
to himself, as he watched the retreating figure of
his servant. “There seems but small chance of
that. Robbery was bad enough; but this is another
matter. She’s dead, and cannot speak; even
if she were alive, she must point to me as Dandy
Chater. And I cannot speak, because the real
Dandy Chater is gone, and I stand here in his
clothes, and with his very papers in my pockets.
Philip, my boy—keep a cool head—for this business
means death!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some morbid attraction, no less than the necessity
for doing something with the body, urged him to
see it. But, here again, the bitterness and the
strangeness of his position came strongly upon him;
for, though he stood in deadly peril of being charged
with the murder of this girl, he was actually
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>ignorant of the spot where her body lay. He
shuddered at the thought that he might stumble
upon it, at any step he took. Still casting about in
his mind for the best method of finding the place,
he went back to the Hall; and resolved to fortify
himself with dinner, before doing anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose, if I really had murder on my soul, I
should have no appetite—unless I were a hardened
villain indeed. Being innocent, I’ll make the best
of things, until they come to the worst.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With this wise resolution, he dined well, and
drank an excellent bottle of wine. The world
beginning to look a little better, in direct consequence,
he lit a cigar, and put the matter philosophically
before himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Men have been hung, I know, on slighter
evidence than that which connects me with the
dead girl. Yet, after all”—he derived very considerable
satisfaction from the remembrance of this
point—“I am not Dandy Chater—and never was.
If I can only as readily persuade people that I am
<i>not</i> my twin brother, as I have persuaded them that
I <i>am</i>—I’ve nothing to fear. That’s the point.
However, I must know what the danger of discovery
is, and exactly where I stand, before I do
anything else. Then—if there is nothing for it but
flight, the question will be: can I as readily drop
my mask as I have assumed it? Frankly, I’m
afraid I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knowing the impossibility of doing anything
alone, by reason of his ignorance of the neighbourhood,
he rang the bell, and requested that Harry
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>might be sent to him. In a few moments, the
servant who had answered the summons returned,
and, standing just within the door, announced that
Harry was not to be found.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked Philip. “Look
about for him, man; he must be somewhere about
the place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Begging your pardon, sir,” replied the man—“’e
’as been seen leavin’ the grounds a little while
since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well; it doesn’t matter,” said Philip, carelessly.
“Send him to me when he returns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man withdrew, leaving Philip Chater in an
uneasy frame of mind. He saw at once that, great
as this lad’s devotion might be to Dandy Chater, he
had already, in a moment of passion, defied his
master. He was scarcely more than a boy—and in
that boy’s hands hung the life of Philip Chater.
That he should have gone out, in this fashion, without
a word, was a circumstance suspicious enough
at any time; that he should have done so now, was
alarming in the extreme to the man who dreaded
every moment to hear unaccustomed sounds in the
house, which should denote that the secret of the
wood was a secret no longer, and that men had come
to take him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t stay here; I shall go mad, if I do,”
said Philip to himself. “After all, there may be
only a few hours of liberty left to me—perhaps
only a matter of minutes. Come—what shall I do
with the time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A certain recklessness was upon the man—the
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>recklessness which will make a man laugh sometimes,
in the certain approach of death. With that
feeling, too, came a softer one; in that hour of difficulty
and danger, he turned, as it were instinctively,
towards the woman who had kissed him—the woman
who had whispered that she loved him. In his bitter
loneliness, as has been said, his thoughts had
turned to her, more often than was good for his
peace of mind; and now a longing, greater than he
could master, came upon him, to touch her hand—perhaps,
by great good fortune, her lips—once
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who knows—it may be for the last time!” he
said. “There has not been so much of tenderness
or beauty in my life, that I can afford to throw it
churlishly aside, when it is given so freely to me.
Madge, my sweet girl—this vagabond, thieving,
murdering, masquerading lover of yours is coming
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With that lighter, better mood upon him, he
sought for the piece of paper, on which the plan
had been drawn, and traced the paths by which he
should reach the cottage; he found, as he had anticipated,
that it was within some two or three
hundred yards of his own lodge gates.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite dark when he strolled out; but he
had the plan very clearly in his mind, and he found
his way, without difficulty, to the place he sought.
It was a good-sized house, of but two stories, and
rambling and old-fashioned; thrusting open a gate,
set in the hedge which surrounded it, he walked
across trim lawns, in the direction of certain long
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>windows, which lighted a terrace, and behind which
the warm glow of lamps and fires was shining.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, before he reached this terrace, he heard an
exclamation, and from out the shadow of some
trees a figure came swiftly towards him. For a
moment, he hesitated, and half drew back; but the
figure came nearer, and he saw that it was Madge
Barnshaw. In his great relief, and in his gladness,
at that time, to see her friendly face, and her eyes
giving him welcome, he took her silently in his
arms, and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Dandy,” she said—and her voice was very
low and soft—“how I have longed to see you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not more, dear heart, than I to see you,” he
replied. “But I—I have been—been very busy;
so many things have occupied my attention—so
many things have needed to—to be done. Why—what
a poor lover you must think me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed—no,” she said. “Only I feared—such
a foolish thought, I know—I feared that something
might be wrong with you—feared that you might
be in danger. Dandy”—she was twisting a button
on his coat round and round in her fingers, and
her eyes were bent down, so that he could not see
them—“you remember once a long talk we had,
about—about your cousin—Mr. Ogledon—don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not, of course, remember it, for an obvious
reason; but, as he was desirous of hearing as much
as possible about that gentleman, he answered diplomatically,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—what about him?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“Dandy—dear old boy—I don’t want you to
think that I am uncharitable, or that this is a mere
woman’s whim. You remember that you were
very angry with me, when last I spoke about him;
you said——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I promise that you shall not make me angry
this time—no matter what you say about him,”
broke in Philip, gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>She raised her head quickly, and looked at him
for a moment or two in silence. “Dandy,” she
said at last, looking at him strangely—“you have
never been so good to me as you are to-night;
never seemed so near to me. That old impatience
of yours seems to be gone. Something has softened
you; what is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it is my love for you, dear Madge,”
he said; and indeed, he thought then that the love
of her might have softened any man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think so?” she asked, smiling at him
happily. “And you will promise not to be angry
at anything I say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most faithfully.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, I mistrust that man. I think a
woman sees deeper into the hearts of her fellow-creatures
than a man can hope to do; perhaps it is
God’s gift to her, for her greater protection. The
world is a sweet and precious place to me—especially
since we have been drawn so much more
strongly together—you and I; but I say from my
heart that it would be a better place if that man
were dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked at her in some astonishment; a rising
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>tide of passion had flushed her face, and drawn her
figure more erect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God forgive me for wishing harm to any living
creature!” she went on, in the same low passionate
voice—“but he is your worst foe, Dandy. Beneath
his smiling, soft ways, he hides the heart of a devil;
and I have seen that in his eyes, when you have
not observed him, which has told me that he would
not hesitate to do you a mischief, if you stood in
the way of anything he desired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater suddenly remembered, even in the
interest he took in what she said, that he had
a part to play. Therefore, with a shrug of the
shoulders, he replied, lightly—“Indeed—you do
him a wrong, Madge. Besides, I can take care of
myself, even if he should be as bad as you paint
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet, how he longed, at that time, to tell her how
true he believed her words to be! How he longed
to fall at her feet, and tell her that the man to
whom her heart had been given had been unworthy
of it; that he was dead, and that another stood in
his place—ready to take his place in a yet greater
sense! But he knew that that was impossible;
only, in his heart, was growing up a dreadful insane
jealousy of the man who was dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is he now?” she asked suddenly, after
a little pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t the faintest idea,” replied Philip, carelessly.
“Come—surely we have something better
to talk about than cousin Ogledon. See—the moon
is rising—the moon that calls to lovers, all the
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>world over, to worship him, and swear by him.
What shall I swear to you, dear Madge?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Swear first of all,” she said, still with that note
of anxiety in her voice—“swear that you will have
as little as possible to do with that man. Ah—do
let me speak”—this as he was about to interrupt
her—“I know, only too well, that I have reason
for my anxiety. Come—if you love me, Dandy
dear—promise me that you will have as little——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed—I’ll promise you that, with a light
heart,” exclaimed Philip. And indeed he had small
desire to have anything at all to do with Mr.
Ogledon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, dear boy—thank you!” exclaimed,
gratefully. “That’s quite like that newer,
better self, which you promised I should see in
you. There”—she bent forward, and kissed him
lightly—“that in token that the matter is ended
between us. Now—what shall we do? The moon
is rising, as you say, and I don’t want to go inside
yet; Miss Vint plays propriety, and never understands
when she is in the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We certainly don’t want Miss Vint,” said
Philip, with a laugh. “Come, my sweetheart—let
us ramble here, for a little time, at least—and talk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After pacing up and down the garden once or
twice, they stopped, side by side, at a little gate
which opened from the further corner of its somewhat
limited extent; as the girl laid her hand upon
it, Philip inwardly wondered where it led. She
swung it open, quite as a matter of course, and as
though that had been a favourite walk of her own
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>and her lover; and they passed through, into a sort
of little plantation. The moon was high, and the
sky clear; their own shadows, and those of the
trees, were sharp and distinct upon the ground.
Still almost in silence, save for an occasional word,
they passed on, side by side, until the gate was far
behind them.</p>

<p class='c009'>A thought had been growing in Philip Chater’s
mind while they walked; and he suddenly put it
into words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have some reason—other than the mere
instinct of which you speak—for disliking Ogledon
so much.” He said it slowly, having been at some
pains to work the thing out in his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought we had done with the matter, and
were not to speak of it again?” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you ought to tell me; I think I ought
to know,” he said, doggedly. “In fact—haven’t I
the right to know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was silent for some moments, while they
still paced on steadily, side by side, leaving the
gate in the garden further behind them at every
step. So intent was he upon the girl, and so
eagerly did he listen for her answer, that he did not
observe that the plantation had changed to something
of denser growth, and that the trees about
them were thick and heavy, and the ground broken
and uneven.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—I suppose you have the right,” she said at
last. “I always suspected the man, Dandy—I always
disliked him. But a little time since, presuming
upon a chance meeting with me, he protested—oh—you
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>will not remember this afterwards—will
you?—he protested his love for me, in a fashion so
violent, that I have feared him ever since. He said
that the stories about you and that girl—Patience
Miller——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Do what he would, he could not repress a start—could
not keep his face wholly within control. So
violent had the start been, that she had stopped instinctively,
and had dropped her hand from his
arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—what is the matter? Dandy dear—you
are ill!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing—nothing is the matter,” he replied,
with a faint smile. “My God—what’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the silence of the place, as the man and the
woman stood looking into each other’s eyes, there
had come, borne upon the still air, the unmistakable
thud—thud of a spade in stiff earth. A question
forced itself to the man’s lips, and found voice,
quite as though some other voice had spoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madge—in Heaven’s name—what place is
this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stared at him, in mingled amazement and
terror; while he, for his part, seemed to count the
steady thud—thud near to them, as he might have
counted his own heart beats, if life were ebbing
from him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What place? Dandy—you are dreaming!
Surely you know that this is the wood—the wood
behind the mill—you know——”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a cry like that of a wounded animal, Philip
Chater sprang from her, and went plunging among
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>the trees, in the direction of that frightful sound.
He came, in a moment, upon something which
brought him to his knees, with a suppressed scream;
the body of a young girl, about whom all the earth
seemed stained a dreadful crimson. Beyond that
sight, was the young lad Harry, up to his knees in
a long shallow trench, in which he was digging
away like a fury. He neither heard his master’s
approach, nor glanced up for a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip turned, and crashed back through the
wood, until he reached the woman’s side again.
“Come away,” he whispered, hurriedly—“it—it is
nothing; come away—for God’s sake!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But she broke from him, and went racing in the
direction he had himself taken, and was lost to
sight in a moment. He heard, through the silence
that brooded awfully upon the place, a piercing
scream; and the next moment she came plunging
headlong past him, and went, staggering blindly,
with her hands before her eyes, in the direction in
which they had walked so calmly but a few moments
before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />A SUMMONS FROM SHYLOCK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For quite a long time, Philip Chater stood, staring
helplessly in the direction in which the girl had
disappeared. All around him was the silence of
the wood, broken only by the call of some night-bird,
or by the whisper and rustle of the branches, stirred
by a rising wind. So still was it all, that he almost
shrieked aloud when a hand was laid softly
on his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Harry—white-faced, and shaking as though
with an ague. He, too, gazed in the direction in
which Philip’s eyes were turned, and spoke in a
frightened whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy—did she—did she see it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The question roused Philip, and put the whole
horrible thing more clearly before him than it had
appeared even in his imagination. He looked
round at the lad, and spoke aloud, and in a tone of
recklessness quite out of keeping with the peril of
his situation. But all considerations of prudence
had been swept aside, at that time; ringing in his
ears still, was the startled scream of the woman he
loved—(yes—he could confess it to his own heart,
now that he had lost her)—before his eyes again
was the sight of her running figure, with its horror-struck
eyes hidden from his view.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>“See it! Of course she saw it. What does it
matter? All the world may see it; all the world
may know of it. Take your spade away, Harry;
you may dig a grave, as deep as the pit of Hell itself,
and yet you shall not hide that thing! Why
do you tremble? What is there for <i>you</i> to tremble
at? Her blood cries out—not against you, but
against me; it cries to Heaven—‘See—Dandy
Chater killed me—Dandy Chater spilled my blood
on God’s fair earth—Dandy Chater——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice had risen to a cry; the other sprang at
him, and clapped a shaking hand over his mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop—stop, for God’s sake!” he cried, huskily.
“Are you mad, Master Dandy—are you mad? I
tell you it can be hidden; no man knows of it but
myself, and Miss Barnshaw will say nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you it shall not be hidden,” cried Philip,
impatiently. “Why—if any one found you here,
digging a grave for it—don’t you understand that
suspicion would fall upon you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care about that, Master Dandy,” he
cried. “Better me than you. Let them think what
they will, Master Dandy; only get you gone, before
the hue and cry is raised.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—I shall not go,” replied Philip, speaking
quite calmly, and with a certain hopeless note in
his voice which was more impressive than any
other utterance could have been. “My dear boy—you
can’t understand that it doesn’t matter one
little bit—now. It has been a blunder and a
muddle, from first to last; Fate has proved too
strong for me—I’ll struggle against it no longer.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>“But, Master Dandy,” urged the eager voice—“won’t
you let me hide it—at least, for the moment?
It will give you time to get away—time to
hide.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you I shall not hide,” said Philip, quietly.
“Come away; I won’t have you mixed up in the
business. Why—dear lad”—he dropped his hand,
for a moment, on the other’s shoulder—“there’s a
sweet girl, whom you love, and who loves you, I’ll
be bound, no matter what she may say. Your life
is straight before you; you mustn’t throw it away
on me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned, and went in the direction he had
come, looking behind him once, to be certain that
the other was following. Suddenly remembering
that he was like a blind man, groping his way,
and having no desire to go near Madge Barnshaw’s
house again, he turned abruptly, when he had gone
a little way, and motioned to Harry to go before
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lead the way,” he said, in the old tone of
authority—“I want to be sure that you don’t go
back again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry passed him, with bent head, and walked
in front. And in that order they came to Chater
Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once inside the home which he felt was rightly
his, and surrounded by the quiet and luxurious repose
of it, the mood of the man changed. He was
but young, and life was very, very sweet. Quixotism,
self-sacrifice, despair; all these things went to
the winds. He was a hunted man, playing a desperate
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>game with chance, with his life for the stake.
Figuratively speaking, he had his back to the wall;
and he meant to make a fight for it, before he gave
in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pretence was gone; and he was more lonely even
than before. The one being who had seemed to
turn to him naturally, avoided him now with
horror, as one whose hands were stained with blood.
Whatever hope might have been in his mind of escaping
was gone; he no longer masqueraded in another
man’s garments, and in another man’s place;
he was battling for his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every moment that I stay here makes the
danger greater; that thing may be found, and they
may be upon me, like bloodhounds, at any moment.
I must clear myself; I must, if necessary, undo all
that I have done, and declare who I really am.
But, if I stop here, I shall be caught like a rat in a
trap. I want time to think—time to plan out what
I must do——What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some one had knocked softly at the door. After
a moment’s pause, Philip Chater, in a nervous voice,
called out—“Come in!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A servant entered, bearing a letter. “I did not
know you were in, sir,” he said. “This came while
you were out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater—doubly suspicious now—looked at
the man curiously as he took the letter. Was it
possible that some one had watched his going out—had
even seen Harry going in the direction of the
wood first, carrying the spade for his awful work?
The spade! It had been left behind, in that half-dug
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>grave; there had been no time even to think
of it. All these thoughts passed rapidly through
his mind, in the few seconds during which the man
handed him the letter—bowed respectfully—and
retired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost mechanically, he tore open the envelope,
and unfolded the sheet within it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is imperative that you should see me at
once. I use the term ‘imperative,’ because it is
necessary that there should be no delay about the
matter. Permit me to add that the business has
reference to the draft, recently paid into my hands,
and drawn by a Mr. Arthur Barnshaw. I must ask
you, if quite convenient to yourself, to be good
enough to call upon me, at my office, to-morrow
(Thursday) before noon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am, Dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Z. Isaacson</span>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The letter bore an address in the neighbourhood
of Old Broad Street, London—and was dated that
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater read the letter through three times,
without coming any nearer to its meaning. Again,
the phrase—“drawn by a Mr. Arthur Barnshaw”—was
more puzzling than anything else. It was,
of course, probable—indeed, almost certain—that
this Mr. Arthur Barnshaw was a relative of Madge;
but, if so, what relative?—and on what terms of
friendship, or otherwise, had he stood with the late
Dandy Chater? All these things had to be discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>“Under any circumstances,” said Philip to himself,
“this letter helps me, and points the road that
I must travel. For the time, at least, I must get
out of the way; this business calls me to London—and
to London I will go. The name of Isaacson has
a flavour of sixty per cent. and promissory notes;
but I must leave explanations to him. I wish I
knew who Arthur Barnshaw is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still with that dread upon him of the fearful
thing in the wood, he determined not to wait until
the morrow, but to start for London that night.
Finding, however, that it was far too late for any
train to be running, he made up his mind to press
Harry into his service; and sent for him, without
any further delay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lad made his appearance at once, and stood
quietly just within the closed door of the room,
waiting for his master to speak. Between the two,
from this night onwards, there seemed a tacit understanding
that something was not to be mentioned
between them, at any time—even while
there was an equally strong understanding—also
unspoken—that each watched for danger, and was
ready to act swiftly, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry—I am going to London. Yes—yes—I
know”—as the other glanced instinctively at the
clock—“it’s too late for trains; I must drive as far
as possible—and walk the rest. I leave all the details
to you; get the horse you think will stay best;
we shall go some fifteen miles, and you can then
drop me, and drive back. Quick—there is no time
to be lost!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>Understanding, only too well, the necessity for
quickness and for caution, Harry returned, in a very
short space of time, to announce that the dog-cart
was in waiting at the gate in the lane, and a bag,
packed with a few necessary articles, already in it.
With the servant leading the way, Philip went
through a long passage he had never traversed before,
and, passing through a low doorway, found
himself under the stars. The two men went silently
across a sort of paddock, and came out into a narrow
lane, where the dog-cart stood waiting, with
the horse fastened to the fence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought it best to do it myself, Master Dandy;
so I sent Jim away, and did the harnessing alone,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite right, Harry,” replied Philip. “Here—you’d
better drive—and take the straight road for
London, once we get past the village.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had come almost to the end of the lane,
when Philip’s quick ear detected the sound of running
feet, on the road towards which they were
driving. He signed to Harry to check the horse
scarcely twenty yards from the road; and they
drew up in the shadow of the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get down,” he whispered to the lad—“and
stroll out into the road to meet them. Find out
what is the matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry jumped down, and reached the road just
as two men came running heavily along it. Philip,
listening intently, while they gave their breathless
answers, knew that the body was found, and that
the frightened yokels were off in search of the village
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>constable. As their hurried footsteps died
away in the distance, Harry came back to the trap,
and climbed in, and took the reins.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were wise to start to-night, Master Dandy,”
he said, as he started the horse. “Bamberton
won’t sleep to-night, with this news in the air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving Bamberton behind them—to be stirred
to its depths presently by the news, and to gather
itself in excited shuddering knots, within and
without the Chater Arms, and other public places;
and to whisper, and shake heads, and offer many
wise suggestions in regard to the murder—Philip
Chater and his companion headed straight for
London. It was pitch dark, and heavy rain had
begun to fall, when, within about ten or fifteen
miles of the first straggling outskirts of the great
city, Philip directed the vehicle to be stopped, and
sprang down into the road. They had rattled
on, mile after mile, in silence; now, as he stood
beside the steaming horse, he looked up at his
servant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Understand, Harry,” he said, “I won’t have you
interfere in this matter again. Keep away from
the wood—keep away from everything and everybody.
I am more grateful than I can say, for your
devotion; and I will not insult you by asking you
to be silent. Keep a stout heart, my lad; I’ll get
clear of this, and be back with you before very long.
Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned away, and struck off alone in the direction
of London; Harry turned the jaded horse, and
started on his journey back to Bamberton.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>It was a very drenched and disconsolate-looking
man that tramped into the slowly awakening streets
of London some hours later. He found a modest
hotel—a sort of superior public-house, of an old-fashioned
type; and, after waiting some considerable
time, was able to get something of a meal, and
to get to bed. But his last thought, as he undressed,
was that this hurried flight, on the spur of
the moment, had been a blunder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry’s devotion and my fright have, I fear,
carried us both away,” he muttered to himself.
“The smuggling out of the dog-cart by a back way;
this hurried race to London; above all—the spade,
taken, I suspect, from the Hall—and left so near
the body; it all points to Dandy Chater. Well—I
must get this interview over to-morrow—or rather
to-day—and see what further troubles are in store
for me. For the moment, I am worn out, and shall
do no good by thinking or planning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He slept soundly, and—a little before noon—presented
himself at the office of Mr. Z. Isaacson, in
the neighbourhood of Old Broad Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a somewhat pretentious place, consisting,
so far as he could see, of but two rooms; the first
of which, at least, was very solidly and heavily furnished.
But by far the most solid and heavy piece
of furniture in the place was the gentleman he imagined
to be Mr. Z. Isaacson—a portly individual,
with pronounced features, much watch-chain, and
some heavy rings on his fat white fingers. Remembering,
in time, that he was probably supposed to
know this gentleman with some intimacy, Philip
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>nodded carelessly, and threw himself into the chair
which the other indicated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad you’ve come, my dear boy,” began Mr.
Isaacson, in a familiar manner. He spoke with
something of a nasal accent, and a little as though
his tongue were too large for his mouth. “You
know—we like to have things pleasant and square,
and <i>I</i> like—as you’ve found before to-day—to do
the amiable, if I can. But, you know, dear boy”—he
passed his large hand over his shining bald
head, and shook that head gravely—“this is rather—well,
you know—really——”</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice trailed off, and he pretended to be busy
with some papers on his desk. Philip Chater looked
at him for a moment, and then broke out impatiently,</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you talking about? What do you
want with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear boy,” said Mr. Isaacson, soothingly—“this
is not the spirit I like to see—it isn’t
really. You and me have had dealings, this year
or two, and you’ve paid the little bit of interest I’ve
asked, fairly and squarely; likewise, I’ve renewed
from time to time—for a little consideration—and
all has been square and pleasant. But, when it
comes to playing it off on an old friend in this fashion—well,
really, you know——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater was in no mood for unprofitable
conversation, especially with a man of this stamp,
on that particular morning. His nerves had been
tried, beyond the lot of common nerves, within the
past four-and-twenty hours; he had had a wet and
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>weary journey, and not too much sleep. Consequently,
the smooth oily utterances of Mr. Isaacson
drove him almost to frenzy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why the devil can’t you say what you’re driving
at, and be done with it. You’ve brought me all
this distance,” he cried, savagely—“and now you’re
mouthing and carrying on in this fashion. What’s
the matter with you? Out with it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Isaacson’s face underwent a sudden change;
certain veins in his temples swelled up ominously,
and he came a little way round his desk; leaning
over it, and putting his face near to that of his visitor,
he said, truculently—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—so you want me to out with it—do you?
You’re not a bit ashamed of what you’ve done——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ashamed? What of?” cried Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forgery! Obtaining money by false pretences!
Robbery! Holy Israel!—how much more do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much more—thank you,” replied Philip,
staggered into calmness. “Perhaps you’ll have the
goodness to explain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There isn’t much explanation needed,” snarled
the other. “The last time you were in this office,
you paid me a cheque for one thousand six hundred
and twenty-six pounds, for accumulated interest,
expenses, and other matters; because I had threatened
that, unless I had that sum, by that date, I
would come down on you, and sell you up. Now,
you knew, Mr. Dandy Chater—and <i>I</i> knew—that
you hadn’t any such sum of your own; therefore
you came to me, bringing a cheque for the amount,
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>on the same bank as your own, at Chelmsford, from
a Mr. Arthur Barnshaw—the brother, so you told
me, of the young lady you expected to marry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(“I’m glad I know who Arthur Barnshaw is,”
thought Philip.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“You told me a pretty story, about his having
lent you the money, out of affection for his dear
sister, and to keep the knowledge of your affairs
from her ears. Now, Mr. Dandy Chater”—the man
brought his hand down upon the desk with a bang,
and became rather more red than before in the face—“perhaps
you’ll be surprised to learn that that
cheque has been referred, on account of the signature,
to Mr. Barnshaw himself; and that he unhesitatingly
states that it is a forgery, and that he
never drew any cheque, for any such amount.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater, utterly at a loss what to say, sat
staring at the man helplessly. The opening of the
door behind him, and a change of expression to
something milder on the part of Mr. Isaacson’s
countenance, caused him to turn his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>A young man—at whom it was unnecessary to
cast a second glance, to assure him that this was
Madge’s brother—had entered the room; had
stopped, on seeing Philip; and now came hesitatingly
forward. He was younger than Philip—scarcely
more, from his appearance, than a year or
two the senior of his sister. He waved aside the
man Isaacson, and said, in a low voice, to Philip—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, old fellow—I’d like to have a word with
you.” Then, as Philip rose, and walked with him
towards a window, he added, in a low voice—“Look
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>here, Dandy—I want to do the square
thing; and I swear to you that, if I’d have known
that this affair had anything to do with you, I should
never have pressed my enquiries. But, you see, the
cheque was made out to the order of that old shark
at the desk there, and I never guessed—now, look
here—you’ve got into a hole, old boy—but I’d like
to pull you out of it, if I can. What can we do?
You see, I’ve got to think, not only of you, but of
Madge; it’ll be such an awful blow to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip wondered whether anything could be a
greater blow to her than the sight on which her
eyes had rested in the wood. But he said nothing.
His one desire, at the moment, was to get clear
away; and to drop, as completely as possible, out
of the life in which he had usurped a place. There
was, too, a wholly foolish and ridiculous idea in his
head, that he would not like this girl, who had
kissed his lips, and had once believed in him—(or in
his dead counterpart)—to have any worse opinion
than she at that time cherished. As by an inspiration,
he remembered that the notes he had received
on the night of the meeting at “The Three Watermen”
were still in his pocket. He determined to
use them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He explained briefly to Arthur—even while he
expressed his regret—that he had unexpectedly
received a considerable sum of money—the proceeds
from some speculations, the shares in which
had long lain useless. He suggested that it might
be possible to bribe that worthy Hebrew at the
desk.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>Mr. Isaacson was not at first to be persuaded;
but the cheque being in his hands—marked “Refer
to drawer”—he at last agreed to sell it, for the sum
of three thousand pounds. Arthur Barnshaw struck
a match—set fire to the tell-tale paper—and allowed
it to burn down to his fingers. “That matter is
done with,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the street, however, a change came over him;
he stood, for a moment, looking at Philip, and then
thrust his hands into his pockets. “I don’t think
I should care to shake hands—not yet,” he said.
“I want to get over this.” He turned, and walked
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same moment, a newsboy—hurrying past—shouted
at the full pitch of his lungs—“’Orrible
murder in Essex! Bank robbery in Sheffield!
Weener!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater staggered, and then walked on, in
a dazed condition. For he knew that he stood—wholly,
in the one case—partly, in the other—responsible
for both.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />A BODY FROM THE RIVER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Captain Peter Quist, for some two or three
days after his parting with Philip Chater, roamed
about uneasily, in his search for a desirable circus
which might happen to be for disposal, and which
might possess the additional advantage of having
attached to it a fat lady or two, who might not
object to show herself, for a consideration, to a
curious public. On more than one occasion, he
entered into negotiations with gentlemen—usually
hoarse as to voice, and inflamed as to countenance—who
appeared, at first, to possess the very thing
he wanted; whereupon, “toothfuls” were exchanged,
and much conversation ensued.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the guileless captain always discovered, when
it came to actual business, that the “circus” consisted
of a caravan or two, in a state of advanced
dilapidation, up a yard; that the horses (if there
had ever been any) were long since dead, or engaged
in agricultural pursuits; that the clowns had long
since left off being funny, and taken, for the most
part, to itinerant preaching; that the fat ladies had
retired from business—married the man who took
the money at the doors—and started public-houses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some three or four days of such hopeless interviewing
having reduced the Captain to a state of
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>despondency, he cast about in his mind for something
which should restore him to his usual condition
of placid cheerfulness; and, having imbibed
somewhat freely of his favourite beverage, and
being then on the outskirts of those narrow and
straggling little streets beyond the actual town of
Woolwich, discovered that the river drew him, like
a magnet—probably from the fact of his legs being
somewhat unsteady, and causing him, for that reason,
to imagine that they were sea-going, like his
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wandering down some slippery stone steps, leading
to a causeway of cobble-stones, and doing so at
the imminent risk of his life, owing to his condition,
the Captain precipitated himself on to the shoulders
of a little man, who was seated on the top of a wooden
post, with his chin propped in his hands, and who
was gazing in a melancholy fashion at the water.
The Captain, having saved both himself and the
little man, by clasping him affectionately round the
neck, broke into profuse apologies. And, indeed,
they were necessary; for the little man—who was
very shabby, and had no linen that was visible, but
whose whiskers had a bedraggled air of having once
been fashionable—was almost speechless with rage
and fright; and danced about on the causeway,
shaking his fist, and threatening—in a thin piping
voice, and with many oaths—his vengeance upon
the Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ere—’old ’ard, guv’nor—’old ’ard,” exclaimed
the Captain. “This comes of gettin’ into bad company;
I’m surprised at a man of your hage, usin’
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>all them naughty words; w’erever did yer learn
’em, mess-mate? It wasn’t my fault, Mister; the
steps was a slide—an’ these ’ere stones is all bumps;
an’ w’en a man comes from a slide to bumps—sudden-like—I
puts it to you that ’e ain’t responsible
for ’isself. An’ I ’umbly asks yer pardon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little man, appearing somewhat appeased,
sat down on his post again, and meditatively pulled
at his whiskers—glancing round now and then at
the Captain, as though apprehensive of his indulging
in some other gymnastic performance. The
Captain, for his part, being of a peaceful nature,
began to make, overtures of friendliness—the more
so that he had a dim notion in his brain that he
had seen the little man on a previous occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, as the little man remained obstinately
silent, despite all the Captain’s conversational overtures,
that gentleman turned his attention to the
boats, several of which were moored near at hand,
with a man sitting near by, smoking, and keeping
an eye upon them. This man, as a familiar spirit,
the Captain accosted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nice boats you’ve got ’ere,” said the Captain,
casually.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah”—responded the man, looking the Captain
up and down—“the boats is all right.” By which
he seemed to imply that somebody else was not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose a man might ’ire a boat—eh?” was
the Captain’s next enquiry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you fink they’re on this ’ere river for the
kids to look at—or to pervide me with amoosement
in bailin’ of ’em out?” asked the man, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>The Captain, meekly repudiating the idea that
any such thought was in his mind, carried his enquiry
a little further, by asking if he might “’ire
one for a hour or so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can yer row?” asked the man, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I what?” shouted the Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man coolly repeated his question, and went
on placidly smoking. The Captain, when he had
recovered his breath, spoke with an unnatural
calmness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’raps, my man, you takes me for a omnibus
conductor,” he said. “Bring round one of them
boats, an’ steady ’er w’ile I gits in—will yer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man, seeing that the Captain really meant
business, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, got into
one of the boats, and slowly pushed it from where
it was moored until it bumped against the causeway.
The Captain, in his delight at the prospect
of being once more afloat, suddenly remembered
the little man with the faded whiskers, who had
sat all this time, absolutely unmoved, on his post.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ere—mess-mate—let bygorns be bygorns—an’
come an’ ’ave a blow.” He clutched the little man
by the arm, in a jocular fashion, and made as if to
pull him towards the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>It unfortunately happened, however, that the
little man was nearly asleep; being pulled from
his seat with such violence, and so unexpectedly, he
had only a dim idea of what was happening, and of
where he was. Realising, however, that he was in
the grip of a stronger man, he suddenly flung himself
fiercely upon the Captain, driving that gentleman
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>backwards towards the boat. The Captain,
for his part, in an endeavour to protect himself,
made a rough-and-tumble of it, and twisted the little
man clean off his legs. Moreover, he twisted
him too far; and, being very unsteady on his legs
himself, fairly rolled with him off the causeway into
the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man in charge of the boat—being, probably,
very glad to get rid of them; and feeling, perhaps,
that they had better be left to settle whatever differences
they might have in their own fashion, immediately
shoved the boat off; so that, by the time
the Captain got his head out of the bottom of the
boat, and sat up to look at his passenger, they were
well out into the stream.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This comes of keepin’ bad company,” murmured
the Captain, ruefully rubbing the back of his head.
“However, I asked you to come fer a blow—and
you’ve come accordin’; but you needn’t ’ave bin in
sich a ’urry, an’ come with sich a rush.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words, the Captain took the oars, and
dexterously pulled into the stream, out of the way
of a lumbering barge—exchanging a little light and
airy badinage with the man in charge of that craft
as it passed him. The little man, who had been so
unceremoniously taken for an airing, appeared to
take the matter in good part; picked up his dilapidated
silk hat from the bottom of the boat—put it
on—and sat, grimly silent, watching the Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a nice arternoon fer a row,” said the Captain
pleasantly, as he pulled sturdily. “Ain’t yer
glad you come alonger me, mess-mate?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>The little man murmured something uncomplimentary,
and then was silent. The Captain, who
began to feel the sobering effects of the breeze and
the exercise, smiled upon him benignly, and pulled
harder. After a long pause, the little man, who
had been staring at him intently, nodded his head
three or four times, and spoke again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought I’d seen you before,” he said, in his
thin piping voice. “Now I’m sure of it. It was
on Tuesday—and you were with that infernal
Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain almost dropped his oars in his astonishment.
“Why—so it was!” he exclaimed. “You
was a sittin’ at the table; I’d seed yer just afore
the light went out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little man, for some unknown reason, began
to tremble; looked all about him, indeed, as though
contemplating making a sudden exit from the boat.
“What do you want with me?” he asked, in a whining
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want nothink with yer,” replied the
Captain, staring at him. “Thought you might like
a turn on the river, in a friendly way—that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t tell lies!” ejaculated the other. “I can
tell you this: you won’t get any good out of me.
I’m only a poor old man, who’s been unfortunate,
and has fallen on evil days. If you think you’ll
make anything out of me, you’re much mistaken.
What do you want with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain looked at him in amazement; the
little man’s terror appeared so strong. “W’y—wot
do you take me for?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>“Oh—I know what you are,” cried the little
man, wagging his head. “You’re a split—a detective—a
policeman. I know what you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain stood up in the boat, and put himself
in a fighting attitude. “Say that again—and
I’ll knock you out of the boat!” he shouted. “I’d
’ave yer know that I’m a decent sailor-man—an’
a captain at that. ’Oo are you a callin’ a policeman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Shady ’un said so,” replied the little man,
tremulously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That Shady gent said a good many things as
’e’ll ’ave to answer for,” said the Captain, sitting
down again. “W’y, if I’d wanted to run yer in, I
reckon I could ’ave picked yer up under my arm,
an’ done it easy, without ’irin’ a boat for it——’Ullo—wot’s
that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boat, travelling slowly, had struck something—struck
it softly, but sufficiently to send a
slight quiver through its timbers. The Captain,
backing water at once, peered over the side; dipped
an oar deep, and swung the boat’s head round with
a sturdy pull; leaned over, and caught at something
bobbing near the surface of the water. His
carelessness had gone in a moment; he was the
quick, masterful man, used to a boat, and used to
matters of life and death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit tight there,” he commanded. “’Ere—ketch
this oar; that’s it—keep her steady. There’s a
body ’ere!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mention of that seemed to stir something in
the little man; he became all attention, in a moment,
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>and watched the other’s movements with
alert eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t get ’im into the boat,” said the Captain,
in a low voice. “’E’s dead—bin dead days, I should
think. Throw me that line there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little man obeying promptly, the Captain,
leaning over the edge of the boat, made the line
fast to that grim thing bobbing alongside; and
then turned the boat’s head for the shore, and
pulled hard. The little man in the stern was so
interested in that grisly passenger, that he must
needs go to the very end of the boat, at the imminent
risk of losing his silk hat—and peer at the
thing as it came along behind, making a wake in
the water as it swept through it.</p>

<p class='c009'>They happened, by this time, to be quite clear of
the town, and to have come to a spot where the
bank was low and flat, and where it was easy to
run the boat ashore. This the Captain did, and
together they leapt out—hauled the boat up—and
afterwards hauled in the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>As it came in on the line, hand over hand—seeming,
in their imagination, to assist the operation
horribly, by crawling up over the dank mud, the
Captain and the little man bent forward together,
to look at it; and started back, as one man, at the
sight of the swollen, distorted features. For it was
the body of Dandy Chater.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dandy Chater—born to such good and prosperous
things—having his beginnings in such fair and
unclouded circumstances—to have come to this at
last! Well for him, surely, that the mother, at
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>whose knee he had lisped his childish supplications
to Heaven, was dead, before this thing fronted the
world, and grinned back at it so horribly! To be
found like this—muddy—soiled—broken—awful—dead—by
two strangers, far away from the fair and
pleasant places through which he had wandered in
his innocent boyhood!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain—raising his head from the contemplation
of what he believed to be the features of
his dead friend Philip Crowdy—was confronted by
the startled eyes of the little man with the faded
whiskers. For a long minute, they stared at each
other in silence; the thoughts of each were busy—for
each had something to hide.</p>

<p class='c009'>For his part, Captain Peter Quist—whatever his
personal grief may have been—bore in remembrance
certain words impressed strongly upon him
by the supposed Philip Crowdy; an injunction laid
upon him not to reveal who he was, or that he was
living under another name. The Captain—good
honest fellow that he was—had a very sincere regard
for his friend; and, believing that he had, in
a moment of indiscretion, got mixed up with some
queer people, was glad to feel that he could bury
the knowledge of it in his own breast, as surely as
the dead man would be buried in his grave. Sorrowing
for him as he did, and bitterly vengeful as
he felt, in his heart, at the mere suspicion that there
had been foul play, he yet had the philosophic feeling
that it did not matter now, as the man was
dead; and the gentle thought that it would be a vile
thing to defame one no longer able to defend himself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>The little man—who was, of course, no other
than the Dr. Cripps of “The Three Watermen”—had
equally strong reasons for preserving silence.
With that scene in the upper room of the little
public-house still clearly before his mental vision,
he saw, in this tragedy, the vengeance of some
member or members of the gang—a vengeance
prompted by fear that Dandy Chater had betrayed
them. Being himself remarkably closely connected
with that gang, he saw his own head in peril, if any
stir were raised about this business. Therefore, it
will be seen that the two men had equally strong
reasons for saying nothing about the identity of
the man who lay dead between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain, however, being, in his sober moments,
a cautious man, looked attentively at the
other, and said slowly—“Bad business—this ’ere.
Do you ’appen to know the gent?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—never saw him in my life. How the devil
should I?” stammered Cripps, with his teeth chattering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor me,” said the Captain. After a long pause,
he asked—“Wot are we agoin’ to do with ’im?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The question was answered for them, in an abrupt
and startling manner; for another face—that of a
very dirty, keen-eyed, ragged-headed urchin, whose
bare feet had brought him silently over the muddy
bank—was obtruded between them, and stared
down into the face of the dead man. Before either
of them had time to say a word, the urchin leapt
to his feet again, with a cry, and scudded away in
the direction of the nearest houses.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>“That’s done it,” murmured the Captain, in a
resigned voice; “we’ll ’ave a policeman ’ere, in no
time.” Then, a sudden thought striking him, he
looked at the little man, and asked slowly—“Wot’s
your opinion of ’ookin’ it, mess-mate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cripps appearing to be too dazed fully to
comprehend the situation, the Captain took him by
the shoulders—gave him a shake or two—and stated
the case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t do no good by stoppin’ ’ere,” he said.
“We shall only be ’awled up at the hinquest, an’
asked awkward questions. Nobody ain’t seen us—’cept
that young limb—an’ I doubt if ’e knows us
again. Therefore—wot I ses is—into the boat with
yer—an’ let’s cut our lucky!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps appearing to grasp this point, after some
difficulty, they left the dead man on the shore, and
pushed off the boat, and made for Woolwich. Going,
without further mishap, up the stream, they
landed at the causeway from which they had so unceremoniously
started—apparently greatly to the
surprise and satisfaction of the man to whom the
boat belonged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got back, yer see,” said the Captain, carelessly,
as he stepped on to the causeway, and gave a hand
to the little man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I see,” replied the man, pocketing the
money which the Captain handed to him. “’Ad a
nice row?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—so-so,” responded the Captain. “I should
like to give you an ’int, young man,” he added.
“W’en you’re a shovin’ orf a boat nex’ time, it
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>wouldn’t be a bad idea to give a man a chance of
settin’ down fust. It ain’t wot you’d call a ’ealthy
style of rowin’, w’en you starts on the back of yer
neck; it don’t some’ow give yer as good a chance,
as if yer started sittin’ down, with a proper ’old on
the oars. <i>Good</i>-arternoon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But, although the Captain was jocular, his heart
was heavy; remembering the hiding and dodging
process through which he had passed, in the company
of the supposed Philip Crowdy, he began to
see some dreadful tragedy—some foul play, which
had caused the death of his friend. Yet, being but
a simple seafaring man, and having a great dread
of the power of the law, he saw himself in unheard-of
difficulties, if he so much as attempted to
stir in the matter. For had he not found the body—and
then fled from it?</p>

<p class='c009'>“From the look of that there body,” muttered
the Captain to himself, as he strolled along, in the
gathering twilight of the streets—“it’s bin in the
water a day or two—in fact, it might ’ave bin
longer, if I didn’t know as ’ow I’d seen poor old
Phil on’y three days back. An’ to think as ’e was
that strong an’ ’earty—an’ now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain did not finish his sentence; he
shuddered, at the remembrance of that awful staring
thing he had left on the muddy bank of the
Thames; and—feeling somewhat faint—looked
about for a house of refreshment.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he emerged, after imbibing several glasses
of his favourite tonic, the world wore a brighter
aspect; and the honest Captain, swaggering along
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>the pavement, with an occasional lurch, as though
a heavy gale of wind had struck him—had clean forgotten
all about unpleasant bodies, or the chances and
changes of this mortal life; had clean forgotten, in
fact, anything but that the world was a good place,
and decent rum a thing to be thankful for.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it happened, by some unlucky chance, that
Philip Chater—drawn, by strong influence, to the
scene of the tragedy which had been so vividly
stamped upon his mind—came, that night, to Woolwich;
merely wandering aimlessly, with no settled
plan as to the future, or, indeed, as to the next
hour. And it happened, too, that, walking slowly
along a dark street, and coming to the corner of it,
he cannoned against a man, who was rolling along
swiftly, chanting a song in a very loud and very
deep voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the Captain; and that gentleman no
sooner caught sight of Philip, than his song stopped,
in the very middle of a note; indeed, the note
turned to a shriek, and Peter Quist, beating off the
supposed apparition with both hands, backed away
from it unsteadily; and then, recovering power of
definite motion, fairly turned tail, and ran as if for
his life—leaving Philip alone, at the corner of the
street, staring after him in blank amazement.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />MISS VINT HEARS VOICES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Philip stood, for some moments, turning over in
his mind the probable cause of the extraordinary
terror evinced by the Captain, while he watched
the flying figure of that gentleman, careering down
the street. After some little thought, he put down
that sudden desire, on the Captain’s part, to get
away from him, to a knowledge of the murder;
and to a natural dread and abhorrence of the man
he supposed to be guilty of it. He turned away,
with bitterness in his heart, feeling that all the
world was against him; and made his way back towards
London by train. Arriving at Charing
Cross, he bought an evening paper, and turned to
see what news there might be concerning the dreadful
thing which was always in his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>More than a column was devoted to it—with interviews
with wholly uninteresting people, of whom
he had never heard, nor, indeed, any one else—giving
their several versions of the matter; how this
one had heard a scream—and another a dog bark—and
how a third had an aunt, who had dreamed of
a man with a red mark on his forehead, about a
week before the occurrence. But there was absolutely
nothing in any report which connected him
with the affair—at least, by name.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>It was stated that the police had several clues;
but that was to be expected. Only, at the end of
the column, was a suggestion that the police had
issued a warrant against a man well known in the
neighbourhood, who had disappeared some two days
before. That was from a telegram dated that
afternoon—Friday.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater sat down, on a seat in the station,
and pondered the matter again. “The warrant is
for me—that’s certain. But there is no mention of
my name—so that that idea about the Captain
goes to the winds. Now—what on earth can have
startled him in that fashion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Turning the paper over in his hands, he came
upon a “Stop-Press” telegram, in the small space
reserved for such things, and read it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The body of an unknown man—well dressed—was
taken from the river below Woolwich this
afternoon. Nothing in pockets to lead to identification.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once again, Philip Chater seemed to stand at the
corner of the dark street in Woolwich; once again,
he seemed to see the ghastly face of the startled
Captain, as he backed away. Philip Chater folded
the paper rapidly, and got up, with an excited face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By all that’s wonderful!—he’s found the real
Dandy Chater!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>That thought, and all that it might involve for
him and so many others, set him walking at a rapid
pace, thinking hard as he went, and without paying
much attention as to the direction he took. But
his thoughts, coming, by a natural transition, to the
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>girl who would be most affected by any news of
Dandy Chater, leapt from thence to the quiet garden,
wherein he had walked and talked with her.
Then in a flash, his mind went back, over the discovery
of the road which led him to the cottage,
to the plan on the scrap of paper—and to the reason
for that plan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Friday night—as soon after ten o’clock as
possible. Only women to deal with!’ Great
Heavens!” he exclaimed—“and this is Friday
night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He hailed a hansom, and shouted to the man to
drive to Liverpool Street Station. Arriving there
in hot haste, he found that he could catch an express,
which would land him at a small town a few
miles from the station at which he had before
alighted for Bamberton. Taking his seat in this, a
few moments before its departure, he found himself,
somewhat to his consternation, in the company of a
couple of men who were discussing the murder in
the wood—evidently newspaper men, judging by
what they said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the first—“I’m going down, so as to
be on the spot if there’s anything fresh. In any
case, I must wire up about half a column.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think we shall probably have some news to-night,”
replied the second man. “Our people have
got hold of an idea that the police have spotted
their man, and may get hold of him within the next
few hours. I hear that Tokely has the case in
hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—smart man, Tokely,” said the other nodding.
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>“I wonder if that swell who was spoken
about had anything to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dare say,” replied his friend, coolly. “If
so, it’ll make rare good copy—won’t it? Trusting
village maiden—young Squire—and all the
other details. By Jove—won’t our people lick it
up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater, sick at heart, turned away, and
tried to busy himself in the paper he had bought.
But the more he tried to read, and to fix his mind
on the page before him, the more hopeless became
the tangle into which the words seemed to form
themselves. He thought of himself—a fugitive; of
his brother, fished out of the river, and perhaps by
this time identified. Philip Chater had but to
think, for an instant, of the contents of his own
pockets at that moment, to realise the desperate
position in which he stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had the dead man’s watch and chain—his
cheque book and other papers; he had upon him
also, a large number of bank-notes, which he knew
must have been stolen, and part of which he had
paid away to cover up a forgery which he was also
supposed to have committed. More than all, he
was venturing now into the very heart of the
enemy’s country, in the hope to stop a robbery,
with which he was also connected—and at the
house of the woman he loved. It is small wonder
that he saw, in all this, a resistless tide, which must
sooner or later sweep him to destruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arriving at the small station for which he had
taken his ticket, he alighted with the two newspaper
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>men, and saw them get into a vehicle which
had evidently been ordered for them. Not wishing
to ask any more questions than were absolutely
necessary, he watched this carriage, as it drove
away, and followed the road it took. Glancing at
the watch he carried, by the light of the last lamp
he passed, he saw that it was nearly eight o’clock;
and he had, so far as he could judge, nearly eleven
miles to go before reaching Bamberton. But his
purpose was a strong one, and the night was fine;
he set out to walk the distance, knowing that he
dared not ask for a lift from any passing cart, lest
he should be recognised.</p>

<p class='c009'>At one or two points on his journey, where sign-posts
were too illegible to be read, or the night too
dark to see them clearly, he was compelled to wait—fuming
and impatient—until such time as a slow-footed,
slow-voiced countryman should come in
sight. At such times Philip Chater pulled his hat
down as far as possible over his face, and kept in
the shadow. But he got through each interview
safely, until within a mile or two of the village—when
taking a wrong turning and losing his bearings
hopelessly, he was obliged to wait again, in the
hope of some one passing him.</p>

<p class='c009'>This time, it was a woman; and she civilly directed
him—showing him a short cut, which would
bring him she said, within a short distance of
Chater Hall. He thanked her, and was turning
away, when she came rapidly nearer to him, and
peered into his face; cried his name, in a sort of
shriek; struck at him; and ran off towards some
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>cottages, where lights were gleaming, screaming—“Murder!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He lost no time in getting away from the spot,
and ran as hard as he could in the direction she had
indicated. He had heard the deep boom of a
church clock strike ten some time before, and his
one desperate fear was that he might arrive too late
to prevent the robbery. At that thought, he redoubled
his efforts, and did not stop until he saw
the huge bulk of Chater Hall looming up against
the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hunted—wretched—forlorn—exhausted, the unhappy
man stood, for a few moments, leaning
against a tree, and contemplating the place that
was rightfully his. He was even in a mood to
curse the father who had banished him, and who
was sleeping, peacefully enough, in the churchyard
near at hand. He almost wished that his own
troubles were ended, and that he was beyond the
reach of pursuit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s hard,” he muttered, savagely—“that I, who
have never wronged any living creature knowingly,
should be in this plight now. If I had had the
chance that was given to my brother, should I have
used it better—or have I merely kept out of temptation,
because temptation kept out of me? Heaven
knows! But, while I stand here cursing my fate,
those wretches have got to work, I’ll be bound, and
may be clear away again before I reach the place.
Now to remember the roads I traversed before—and
yet to keep out of the sight of all men, and”—he
added, as an after-thought—“all women!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>With these words, he crept round, as near as he
dared, to the front of the house, and struck off
cautiously from there in the direction of the cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it happened that night that Madge Barnshaw,
being wholly occupied with sad thoughts,
and having no friendly being in whom she could
confide, or to whom she felt disposed to tell the
tragic story which was by this time in every mouth,
had gone early to her room, leaving Miss Vint—her
distant cousin and guardian—nodding over the fire.
Arthur Barnshaw, who had arrived from town only
the day before, was in the room he called his “den,”
reading and smoking, and the house was very quiet.
Miss Vint, being very comfortable, fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she awoke, the fire had long gone out, and
the room was chilly. Miss Vint rose, shuddering
and yawning, and, having extinguished the light,
went out into the hall; took her candle, and slowly
and sleepily mounted the stairs to her chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing a window on the staircase, immediately
below the level of her own room, Miss Vint stopped
suddenly, and became very wide awake. Clearly
and distinctly, in the death-like silence which pervaded
everything, Miss Vint had heard a voice—muffled
and cautious—apparently proceeding from
below. What the words were that were spoken,
she could not say; but she had distinctly heard a
voice—and that voice the voice of a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the worthy lady had had time to decide
what to do, another voice—as muffled and cautious
as the first—answered; only, in this case, it appeared
to come from above—almost as though (but
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>the idea was, of course, too ridiculous to be entertained)
the first speaker had been outside, in the
garden, and the second at an open window, speaking
down at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Vint’s first natural thought was to rush
downstairs, and summon Arthur Barnshaw to her
assistance. But it was a long way downstairs, and
there was a dark and ghostly corridor to be traversed
before she could reach him. On the other hand,
her room was quite close; she had but to dash up
three steps, open the door, plunge in, and find herself
in safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly, Miss Vint took the plunge; flung
open the door—shut it hurriedly—and locked it on
the inside. At the same instant, Miss Vint’s candle
was softly blown out, and a strong firm hand was
placed over Miss Vint’s mouth—a hand which
pressed her, not too ceremoniously, against the
door she had locked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a word,” whispered a voice, huskily.
“Scream—and I’ll knock yer bloomin’ brains out.
I ain’t alone; there’s pals o’ mine outside, as
mightn’t be so considerate of a lady’s feelin’s.
Now—are yer goin’ to be quiet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Vint nodded her head, as well as she could
for the steady pressure of the hand upon her mouth,
and the man relaxed his hold. She could just dimly
discern his figure, looming large above her, in the
dim light which came from outside the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you want?” asked Miss Vint, in a
frightened whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got wot we want,” replied the man, in
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>a low voice—“an’ nobody ain’t ’urt a bit. I
found my way into the young lady’s room, without
wakin’ of ’er—an’ now I’ll wish you good-night.
On’y mind”—the man paused, for a moment, to
give his words greater effect—“I’ve got something
’ere wot’ll keep yer quiet, if I ’ears any noise from
yer.” Miss Vint felt something hard and cold touch
her forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My good man,” whispered Miss Vint, tremulously,
“you may be sure I will not place you under
the necessity for doing violence upon me. I would
only beg that you will join your companions—I
hesitate, in your presence, to call them depraved,
although I fear they are not what they should be—and
leave me in peace. Your friends are evidently
impatient to see you.” This last was in reference
to a low whistle, which sounded from the lawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man, after hesitating for a moment, moved
slowly towards the window, which Miss Vint
noticed, for the first time, was wide open; and got
one leg over the sill; looking back at her, he shook
a fist, by way of caution to her to be quiet; lifted
the other leg over, and slowly disappeared—apparently
down a ladder—from her view.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then it was that Miss Vint, no longer restrained
by the fear of his presence, opened her mouth, and
emitted a long and piercing shriek—a shriek so
tremendous, that it brought Arthur Barnshaw
tumbling out of his den, half asleep, and stumbling
blindly in the darkness; and brought another man,
who had been crouching behind a hedge, leaping
over it, and hurrying to the scene. Having accomplished
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>these useful purposes, Miss Vint backed
towards her bed, and fainted away, with propriety
and comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second man, who had leapt the hedge, was
no other than Philip Chater; and, as he hurried to
the scene, he caught a momentary glimpse of the
little drama that was going forward. In the first
place, he saw a man hurriedly and unceremoniously
coming down a ladder from a window; saw him
thrust something into the hands of another man,
who stood near at hand, and make off in another
direction, clearing the low hedge at a bound, and
vanishing in the darkness. While this was happening,
the door of the house had been wrenched open
from inside, and a young man had dashed out, and
grappled with a taller figure, standing also near the
ladder—a taller figure which, after a short struggle,
threw the man who grappled with him, and made
off also, in the same direction as the first. All this
passed within a few seconds, and before Philip had
had time to do anything. But he saw, at this
moment, that the man into whose hands that something
had been thrust, by the man who had come
down the ladder, was making off also—not with the
strength of the others, but as though he were older
and weaker. This man Philip Chater immediately
seized; when, to his consternation, the man in his
grip—(and who was no other than our friend Dr.
Cripps)—after one horrified glance into his face,
fell upon his knees, babbling and stuttering; and
then, casting from him what he held, broke away, and
went careering like a madman across the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>Philip, for his part, was so astonished, that he
made no effort to follow the little man; but, seeing
something gleaming, in the faint light of the stars,
on the ground at his feet, stooped, and picked it
up. Having dropped on one knee in doing this, he
was absolutely powerless to defend himself, when a
man sprang upon him, caught him by the throat,
and forced him backwards to the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got one of you, at least,” cried a voice
which sounded curiously familiar. “It’s no use
struggling; you won’t get away, I can assure you.”
Then, as he caught sight of the face of his prisoner,
he dropped his hands from Philip’s throat, and
struggled to his feet, and stood staring down at
him. It was Arthur Barnshaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment or two, there was a death-like
silence between the two men; then Philip spoke,
although he knew that what he had to say would
sound futile and absurd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I heard that this robbery was to be committed—and
I came here, as rapidly as I could,
in the hope to prevent it,” he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Barnshaw’s voice was cold and hard when he
replied. “Indeed? How did you hear of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In—in London—quite by accident.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is that you have in your hand?” asked
Barnshaw, in the same tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip slowly raised his hand, which held the
thing Dr. Cripps had dropped, and held it up in the
light; it sparkled and glittered, and threw back a
hundred changing brilliancies to the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is my sister’s necklace,” said Barnshaw.
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>“Give it to me.” Then, as he took it in his hand,
he said slowly—“This was taken out of the house
to-night, by the men who have escaped. They have
all got away—except yourself——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good God, Barnshaw,” faltered the other—“you
surely don’t think——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You knew that the robbery was to be committed;
so much, on your own confession. I find you
hiding in the garden, with this actually in your
hands.” Without another word, he turned, and
walked slowly back to the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some moments, Philip knelt upon the ground
where the other had left him, staring after Barnshaw
like one stunned. Then, slowly and heavily,
he rose from his knees and went out of the garden,
with bowed head, and without once looking round.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, Dr. Cripps, being incapable of the
feat of agility which had carried his friends over the
hedge, went crashing straight through it; ducked
suddenly, and ran along on the other side, beneath
it, in order to keep out of the view of any one who
might be on the lookout for him. And, running
thus, he dashed straight into the arms of a man who
was also crouching down behind it. After a very
brief struggle, feeling himself in a grip from which
it was impossible to escape, he resigned himself to
circumstances, remained passive, and looked up at
his captor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ogledon!” he ejaculated. “I thought it was a
policeman!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man into whose hands he had fallen shook
him until his teeth seemed to rattle, and whispered
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>angrily—“So you’ve bungled it, have you?—rousing
the house in that fashion. Who’s got the necklace?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“D-D-Dandy C-C-Chater!” stuttered Cripps,
faintly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man dropped him, as hurriedly as though he
had been red-hot; looked all about him; and seemed
to breathe hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean? What the devil are you
talking about?” He spoke in what seemed almost
a frightened whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little man, bewildered alike by the shaking,
and by the sudden change in the demeanour of Ogledon,
lost his balance completely, and stammered
out—</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s no good—the devil is in everything. I
fished him out of the river only this very day, and
laid him on the bank, as dead as twenty doornails;
yet he caught me in the garden here just now, and
stared straight into my eyes—and he’s got the diamond
necklace!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re mad!” whispered the other, in the same
uneasy fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not—I’m not—but I soon shall be!” muttered
Cripps. “I tell you that Dandy Chater is
dead—been dead for days; and yet he’s got the
necklace, and is in that garden”—he pointed awfully
behind him, as he spoke—“at the present moment.
As sure as I’m a living sinner—Dandy Chater has
come to life again!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />WANTED—A DEAD MAN!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For quite a long minute, Ogledon stared at the
trembling Cripps—knitting his brows, and biting
his lips at him—the while he turned this thing over
in his mind. And the more he stared at Cripps,
the more did that gentleman continue to babble of
Dandy Chater dead, and Dandy Chater alive and
with the diamond necklace. Presently, the strong
common sense of the bigger man seemed to assert
itself; he caught Cripps by the shoulder, and shook
him again, and compelled his attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now—listen to me, you chattering idiot!” he
said. “Are you certain that you took Dandy Chater’s
body from the river?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cripps nodded vehemently. “Certain of it,”
he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just below Woolwich.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as I thought,” muttered Ogledon to himself.
Aloud, he said,—“You’ve been drinking, you
little scoundrel, and the sight of a body has upset
you. You’ve been drinking spirits—and seeing ’em
afterwards. Now—listen to me again; it will be
worth your while. This Dandy Chater, being dead,
everything he possesses belongs to me; I am the next-of-kin.
I’m going now straight to Chater Hall;
you’ll have to go with me; and your business will be
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>to hold your tongue, and follow all that I do, and
take your cue from me. Dandy Chater come to life
again!” he added, with a sneer, giving Cripps a final
shake, and casting him roughly off. “You’re killing
yourself with all the liquor you take, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After listening carefully for some little time, and
hearing no disturbing sounds to break the silence
all about them, he set off cautiously in the direction
of the Hall, followed closely by Cripps. And, as
he went along, he reviewed his position.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now—I must not forget,” he muttered to himself—“that
I have but just returned from a journey,
and know nothing of what has happened in my absence.
If they know of Dandy’s death, I must be
properly horrified at the news; if he has merely
disappeared, and they have heard nothing of him—(which
I suspect will be the case)—I must be filled
with surprise and alarm accordingly. In any case,
I play the innocent, and take advantage of what I
know, and of what turns up. And I must carry off
everything with a bold face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Acting upon this resolve, Ogledon made his way
to Chater Hall, and loudly rang the bell. It being
now nearly midnight, the house was in complete
darkness; but, after a time, shuffling feet were
heard within, bolts were drawn, and the great
doors were slowly opened. Ogledon, advancing
boldly, with Cripps sticking close at his heels, confronted
a couple of astonished and sleepy-eyed
men-servants; pushed past them, and went into
the great dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evening, Simms—evening, Barker—or, perhaps
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>I should say, almost morning,” said Ogledon, pleasantly.
“I’ve only just arrived from a long journey,
and am tired and hungry. You need not disturb
any one else; I dare say you can get me—and
my friend here,” he added, as an after-thought—“something
to eat, and to drink. Anything cold
will do; only be quick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The men hastened away, to do his bidding. But,
just at that moment, a sharp clear voice sounded
from upstairs, calling to the men, and demanding
to know who had arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon, listening intently, heard the men give
his name, and state what they were doing for his
comfort. But this did not appear to satisfy the
owner of the voice; for, a few moments afterwards,
a rustle of garments was heard on the staircase,
and then in the hall; and, the door opening, displayed
the figure of Mrs. Dolman the housekeeper,
in an antiquated wrapper, and with a light shawl
over her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Truly, Mr. Ogledon—truly, gentlemen”—this
latter, as she caught sight of Cripps—“I trust you
will excuse so informal a reception. Of course, had
we expected you, preparation should have been
made, and the servants waiting. But, of course, I
did not know——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not, Mrs. Dolman—of course not,”
broke in Ogledon, cheerfully. “No excuses are
necessary, I assure you; both myself and my
friend—permit me; Dr. Cripps—Mrs. Dolman—the
worthy housekeeper here—are quite prepared to
take pot-luck, I can assure you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>Now, when the housekeeper had entered the
room, Dr. Cripps, after one momentary glance at
her, had turned his back, and pretended to be busy
with some books upon a side table; but, having
now to turn, in acknowledgment of the introduction,
he gave the old lady one searching glance,
bowed, and turned away again. But not before she
had looked quite as keenly at him, and had clasped
her hands, in sudden recognition and astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—dear me!” cried Mrs. Dolman—“if my
eyes do not deceive me, I am known to this gentleman—though
it’s many years since I had the pleasure——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are perfectly right,” replied Cripps grudgingly,
seeing that there was no help for it. “I am
the Dr. Cripps who used to practice in this place,
and who——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who brought Master Dandy into the world!”
cried the old woman, clasping her hands again.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Doctor nodded, and turned away, as if to
put an end to the conversation; Ogledon was watching
him curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And little did I think, those many years ago,
that ever it should have come to this, gentlemen,”
went on the old lady, with tears starting to her
eyes—“with Master Dandy gone, God knows where,
and lying tongues wagging about him, and he not
here to defend himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon took her up quickly. “Lying tongues,
Mrs. Dolman? And what, pray, are they daring
to say about our dear Dandy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems, sir, that there has been a body found—of
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>a young girl who belonged to these parts—in
a wood near by; and, because Master Dandy has
been seen talking to her once or twice—(as young
men will, and always have done, since the good
Lord made young men and women!)—they must
needs go whispering about that Master Dandy
made away with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon drew in his breath sharply, and rose
from his seat; confronted Mrs. Dolman for a moment,
in an amazed silence; and finally spoke, in a
voice which shook a little with his anxiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand,” he said. “Do you suggest
that Mr. Chater is accused of murder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what they dare to say, sir,” replied the
old lady. “And as he’s been gone from here—and
left no word as to where he is—since Wednesday——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon, who had turned partially from her,
even while he listened intently to all she said,
swung round quickly, and interrupted her. “My
good woman—what day did you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wednesday, sir. Master Dandy went from here
very late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon looked at her, for a moment, in blank
amazement and terror; put his hand to his shirt
collar, and tugged at it, as though he found a difficulty
in breathing; moved away a step or two, and
then came back to her, smiling in rather a ghastly
fashion. He spoke with some little impatience, and
yet very clearly and distinctly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I want to be very—very clear about this,
Mrs. Dolman,” he said, speaking in a gasping,
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>breathless sort of fashion, as one deeply agitated,
and yet striving to keep control of himself. “I—I
have been away in France—Paris—and have only
just returned. Mr. Chater and I, as you know, left
here a week ago—a week this night—I went to
London in the morning—he came on late at night,
and met me there. We—we parted—that night;
I”—the man passed his hand quickly over his forehead,
and tugged again at his shirt collar—“I have
not seen him since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir,” replied the housekeeper—“he came
back the next day, sir—Saturday——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The expression on Ogledon’s face stopped her;
she looked at him uneasily. He recovered his composure
somewhat, and was about to start again to
question her on that disquieting matter, when the
two servants entered the room, with the materials
for supper. Dr. Cripps had, long before this, discovered
a decanter of spirits, and had been helping
himself rather liberally to the contents. He came
up to the table now, still carrying the decanter,
and moaning out a song in a wheezy and cracked
voice; sat down, with the decanter at his elbow,
and—utterly oblivious of every one else—began his
supper; taking a great deal to drink, and very little
to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon being in no mood, with that question
still unanswered, for any meal, waited until the men
had withdrawn, and then once more approached
Mrs. Dolman. White-faced and in deadly anxiety
though he was, his smile was soft and kindly, and
his voice—albeit a trifle impatient at times of what
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>he supposed to be the good woman’s perversity—as
soft and kindly as his smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now—my dear Mrs. Dolman—pray excuse my
pestering you with questions at such an hour, I beg—I
am desperately anxious about my cousin, Mr.
Chater. You say you saw him on Saturday; are
you sure you are not confusing the dates?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the housekeeper’s turn to stare now; after
doing so for a moment, in evident perplexity, she
shook her head vigorously. “No, Mr. Ogledon—certainly
not,” she said; “Master Dandy came down
on Saturday—driving from the station in a fly. I
sent down to ask if you were expected, sir—and he
said he did not know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here a remarkable and ghostly interruption came,
in the form of a long wailing chant from Dr.
Cripps, who suddenly broke forth, in a quavering
treble, with a stave of—“Down Among the Dead
Men.” Ogledon, turning furiously, fell upon his
friend, and shook him so vigorously, that the little
man seemed, for a few moments, in danger of being
shaken out of existence altogether. When, however,
Ogledon desisted, Cripps merely looked round
about him dizzily; smiled, quite as though it were
an exercise to which he was accustomed; and set
to work drinking harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime, Ogledon had turned again to the
housekeeper—and began once more to peg away at
that subject of the dead man, as though he could
never leave it alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did—did Mr. Chater seem—seem well?” he
asked, with some assumption of carelessness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>“I never saw him looking better, Mr. Ogledon,”
replied the housekeeper, tranquilly. “And now,
gentlemen,” she added—“seeing that you have all
you require, I will take the liberty of going to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By all means,” responded Ogledon, appearing
to wake suddenly from a heavy musing fit which
had been upon him. “By all means, Mrs. Dolman.
You are quite sure, Mrs. Dolman—quite sure that
you have made no mistake about the date?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite certain, Mr. Ogledon,” she replied, a little
coldly. “I am not likely to make such mistakes as
that, sir; it was impressed upon me the more, perhaps,
because Master Dandy got up very early the
next morning—Sunday that was—and afterwards
went to church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy Chater went to church!” exclaimed
Ogledon; and, at the mere suggestion of such a
thing, he smiled in good earnest, despite the seriousness
of the matter to him. His face cleared a
little; he seemed to see an easy solution of the
business. “My good soul—you have certainly been
dreaming; Dandy Chater would never have gone
to church!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dolman looked at him for a moment, in majestic
silence; drew herself up to her full height, as
though about to make a withering speech; remembered
her position, and merely bade him “Good-night”;
and walked, in a stately fashion, from the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long time, Ogledon paced the room restlessly—stopping
every now and then, on the opposite
side of the table to Cripps (who had fallen
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>asleep, with an arm thrown lovingly round the decanter)
to look at that gentleman doubtfully, as
though half inclined to wake him, and endeavour
to get something out of him. But at last, a new
thought striking him, he rang the bell, and waited
near the door until one of the sleepy men-servants
answered the summons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Simms,” he said—not looking at the man, but
keeping his eyes fixed on the floor—“has Harry
Routley gone to bed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hours ago, sir,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wake him at once; tell him I want to see him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some ten minutes later, Harry knocked at the
door, and came in; having dressed hurriedly, and
having all the appearance of one roused unexpectedly
from sleep. Ogledon nodded to him, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry—I’m sorry to trouble you, at such an
hour as this, but I am worried about Mr. Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the mention of that name, the lad suddenly
became rigid, and set his lips, as though with the
determination to say nothing. Ogledon, after a
pause, went on again, evidently disconcerted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We—Mr. Chater and I—have somehow—somehow
missed each other. I was called—called
abroad; I parted from him rather—hurriedly.
Coming back to-night I hear from Mrs. Dolman
that he—that he has gone away again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. Last Wednesday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If Harry had suddenly dealt Ogledon a heavy
blow, he could not have staggered or surprised him
more. Recovering instantly, however, he came at
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>the other with a rush, and caught him by the
throat; his dark face almost livid with passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You hound!” he said, in a sort of hoarse
whisper—“this is a trick—a lying tale, hatched up
amongst you here. Do you want to drive me
mad?” Then, seeing the look of blank amazement
and growing wrath in the other’s eyes, his mood
changed swiftly, and he dropped his hands, and
passed one over his forehead, in the same nervous
fashion as before. “I—I beg your pardon, Harry;
I had no right to speak to you in such a way. But
I—I have been ill—and am faint—faint and weak,
from a long journey, and but little food. Take—take
a glass of wine, Harry—and then answer me
clearly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned to the table, and poured out wine with
a shaking hand; carried it—spilling a little as he
did so—to the lad. But Harry shook his head, and
seemed to put away the glass with his hand. He
was suspicious of every one and everything at that
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can answer you quite clearly, sir,” he said,
brusquely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Chater went with me to London—not with
me, but on the same day; we met in London—a
week ago. I have not seen him since. Have
you?” He seemed to listen for the answer of the
other, as though his life hung upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. Master Dandy came down the next
day, quite unexpectedly; went to church——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon signed to him with his hand to go away.
“That will do,” he said. “You can go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>When he was left alone in the room with the
sleeping Cripps, he went almost mechanically, as it
seemed, to the table, and unsteadily poured out some
brandy, and drank it. Then, with an awful eager
hurry upon him, he ran round the table, and caught
Cripps by the shoulders, and dragged him to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wake up, you drunken fool—wake up!” he
cried, in a voice but little greater than a whisper.
“I shall go mad, if I stop here alone, with this
thing weighing upon me. Come—open your eyes;
listen to what I have to say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cripps, striving hard to go to sleep again,
even while held upright by his friend, tried a line
or two of his former lugubrious ditty, and smiled
feebly. Ogledon, all impatience however, brought
him rapidly to something of sobriety, by unceremoniously
emptying the remains of a glass of spirits
over him; whereupon he shuddered, and shivered,
and opened his eyes fully; and stood upright without
assistance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Cripps—just attend to me—for I mean
business. If you deceive me, by so much as a word,
it’ll be the worse for you. You tell me you took
this body from the river? What day was that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Doctor blinked his eyelids, moistened his lips
with his tongue, and looked extraordinarily grave.
“Thish afternoon—no—thish is to-morrow mornin’—ain’t
it? Yeshterday afternoon, I mean——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know what you mean; you mean a few hours
since—say, ten or a dozen—eh?” cried Ogledon,
impatiently, yet always in that low, cautious tone.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>“Thash it,” replied the Doctor, fast merging into
sleep again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well then. You understand your business,
I suppose; how long had this man—this body—been
in the water?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five—shix days—p’raps a week,” said the
other. Then, suddenly becoming more sober, at the
recollection of what had so recently happened, the
little man waved his arms wildly, and exclaimed,
in his thin piping voice—“But that’s nothing—nothing
’t all. Dandy Chater came to meeting;
took bank-notes—his own—yours, too——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the devil are you talking about?” cried
Ogledon, almost as wildly as the other. “What
meeting—what notes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tuesday. The boys divided up—share and
share alike—Dandy took yours and his own. And
to-night—ugh!—he was in that damned garden,
and took the necklace. He takes everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon wiped his face, and even his hands, and
poured out more brandy. Drinking it, he looked
over the top of the glass at Cripps; set the glass
down, and stood nervously beating his hands together,
and biting his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cripps,” he said at last, in a whisper—“this
thing has got the better of me. As sure as Heaven,
Dandy Chater is—is dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Doctor saw something in Ogledon’s eyes
which completely sobered him; he sank down helplessly
in a chair. “You don’t mean—” he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon nodded. “We—we had a row. We’ve
had—had rows before. Besides—the fool was in
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>my way—in my way everywhere. I’d got out of
him all I wanted. I followed him down to the
river, a week ago, and struck him down there—from
behind. I know he was dead; I felt for his heart.
Then I made a bolt for it; got to Paris, so as to be
out of the way—and came back here only to-day.
I’ve watched the papers, for a week; I came back,
expecting to hear that the body had been found,
and that this house was in mourning. Cripps—as
Heaven’s above us, there is some devilish Thing going
about—from the grave—from anywhere you
will—in the likeness of this man we both know to
be dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little Doctor was trembling from head to
foot; not sober enough yet to understand the magnitude
of the thing, and having, after that lapse of
twenty-eight years, but a dim and fleeting recollection
of the birth at Chater Hall. Indeed, then,
as now, he had been always in so hazy a condition,
that it is doubtful if he remembered the real circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has been seen at this meeting; it came here;
it dogged us to-night. I’m—I’m choking, Cripps;
I must have one of these windows open.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He crossed the room hurriedly, and flung back a
heavy curtain, which hung across the long French
window which opened on to the terrace. But, the
next moment, he started back with a scream, and
covered his face with his hands; for there, in the
clear cold light of the moon, stood the living image
of Dandy Chater, looking calmly at him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />INSPECTOR TOKELY IS EMPHATIC</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In one of the many rooms of that barrack-like
building, which harbours so many guilty secrets,
and is so learned in many shady ways of life, and
is known to all and sundry as Scotland Yard,
there worked—with long intervals for mysterious
disappearances into various parts of the country—a
small man, with a hard, expressionless face,
ornamented with a tuft of greyish hair on the
chin.</p>

<p class='c009'>This man had once had the extraordinary good
fortune to pick up a vital piece of evidence—literally,
to trip over it; for it was right in his way,
and he could not well avoid it. But it brought him
into prominent notice; it got him talked about; and,
as he was wise enough to appear absolutely impassive,
when complimented by his superior officers,
and even by a great and bewigged Judge on the
Bench, he gained greater credit still; was spoken
of with bated breath, by criminals acquainted, by
experience, with some of the intricacies of the
Yard; and sagely nodded over by those in authority.
Then, one lucky chance following another, he
rose up, by dint of that hard expressionless face, to
something greater still; and, steering clear of
blunders, and getting other men with brains to
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>secure information for him, blossomed at last into
Inspector Tokely, of the Criminal Investigation
Department.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, this same Inspector Tokely was a native of
the small and unimportant village of Bamberton;
had come up from it, indeed, as a raw youth, to
enter the police force in London. So that, when
news came of the murder of poor Patience Miller,
and a request that the matter might be investigated,
Inspector Tokely, instead of sending a subordinate,
determined to combine business with pleasure, and
to see his native place. Thus it came about that
the great little man descended on the village, early
on the afternoon preceding Philip’s night adventure
in the garden, and stirred the already startled community
of yokels to its depths.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reversing the copybook maxim, Inspector Tokely
determined to take pleasure before business, and to
flutter with envy the bosoms of his former acquaintances.
Therefore he put up, with some ostentation,
at the Chater Arms; and took his expressionless
face, with its dependent tuft, into the bar of that
hostelry, when some half-dozen village celebrities
were assembled in it. Old Betty Siggs, being busy
at the moment, and not having set eyes upon him
since his boyhood, failed to notice his entry, or to
recognise him other than as a casual visitor. The
Inspector, looking down from his height of superior
importance and criminal experience on the mere
hinds on whom Mrs. Siggs was attending, coughed
vigorously to attract her attention, and dropped his
portmanteau with a bang upon the floor. Mrs.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>Siggs, smiling and pleasant, came across, and civilly
enquired what she could do for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall sleep here for a night—possibly two or
three,” replied Tokely, in a loud voice, and with a
side glance to note the effect of what he said upon
the mere hinds before-mentioned. “I am here upon—upon
business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, sir,” said Mrs. Siggs, briskly. “It ain’t
many commercial gents we gets down to Bamberton,
sir—’cept by accident. Would you wish to
’ave a meal prepared, sir? P’raps you’d be so good
as step this way, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like something to eat, certainly,” replied
the Inspector. “And I am not here on commercial
business; quite the contrary. My business
is connected with the—the Law.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’!” exclaimed Mrs. Siggs, as she led the way
into the little parlour; this exclamation not being
intended as an echo of the Inspector’s last word, by
any means. “I ’ope we shall be able to make you
comfortable, sir, w’atever your business may be.
This way, sir. P’raps you might like to take a
little summink afore your meal, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Inspector Tokely gave the order for the “little
summink,” as well as for the meal, and then turned
to Mrs. Siggs as she was leaving the room. “One
moment, my good woman,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Siggs hesitated, with her hand on the doorknob,
and looked at him curiously—not at all prepossessed
in his favour. The Inspector, leaning
against the table, and putting his head a little
on one side, conveyed into his hard features something
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>as nearly approaching a smile as he was capable
of.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t know me, I suppose?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Siggs shook her head slowly, after looking
him up and down for a few moments in some perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you don’t,” said Tokely, grimly. “Do
you remember a lad—a lad of superior intelligence,
I might say—who used to be a sort of under-keeper
up at the Hall—by name Tokely?” The Inspector
smiled a little more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Siggs, after a moment or two of frowning
contemplation of the floor, looked up at him with
a brightening face. “To be sure I do,” she said.
“When I was a gel about ’ere—remember ’im well,
I do. Let me see now”—Betty Siggs, immersed in
recollections of the past, lost sight of her visitor for
a moment completely—“chuckle-headed chap ’e
was—with a taste for spyin’ out things wot didn’t
concern ’im——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was nothing of the sort,” broke in Tokely,
very red in the face. “He was a lad considerably
above the average of rustic intelligence—and he
made his way in the world, Ma’am, I should like
you to know—got his name in the papers, more
than once——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—lots o’ folks manages to do that, without
meanin’ it,” said Betty Siggs, with a little laugh.
“I’ve knowed a man to do it by breakin’ a winder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind about that,” said the Inspector,
testily. “The young man I’m talking about got on
in the world, by sheer merit. <i>I</i> am that young
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>man, Ma’am”—the Inspector tapped himself dramatically
on the breast—“now Inspector Tokely, of
Scotland Yard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Betty Siggs went a little white about the region
of her plump cheeks; clasped her hands; and
faltered out—“Of—of Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Criminal Investigation Department, Ma’am,”
went on the Inspector, tapping himself on the
breast again. “Have the goodness, Ma’am, to shut
that door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Siggs put a hand out, to do as she was
bidden, never taking her eyes for a moment from
the face before her. Indeed, after shutting the
door, she stood with her hand upon the knob, as
though ready to pull it open in an instant, and
scream for assistance, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Ma’am,” began Tokely, wagging his head
and a forefinger at her, by way of caution—“I
want to ask you a question or two; and I’ll trouble
you to be very careful what you say, or what you
don’t say. I have been commissioned to enquire
into a case, touching a certain female of the name”—he
pulled a pocketbook from his coat, and dived
into it for a moment—“of the name of Patience
Miller. Now, this same Patience Miller——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Betty Siggs suddenly threw up her hands, and
clapped them over her ears. Performing a species
of little dance, entirely on her own account, with
her two feet, she shut her eyes, and called out—“Stop—stop—it
ain’t no use! If you puts me on
the rack, and draws me out till I’m as thin as the
four-ale over the way (and there can’t be anythink
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>much thinner than <i>that</i>)—you won’t get nothink
out of me. I know no more than anybody else—not
so much, in fact—and what I does know I ain’t
agoin’ to tell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you defy the Law—do you?” roared Tokely—for,
Betty Siggs still keeping her hands tightly
pressed upon her ears, there was no other way to
make himself heard. But Betty Siggs did not wait
to hear an account of whatever terrors might be in
store for her; watching her opportunity, she
wrenched open the door, and darted through into
the bar, where—judging by a confused murmur,
which presently sprang up, of heavy rustic tongues,
leavened pretty strongly by her own shrill voice—she
immediately began to stir up war against Inspector
Tokely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor did the Inspector see her again for some
time. His meal was served to him by a very pretty
black-eyed girl, who—evidently secretly instructed
by Mrs. Siggs, returned evasive answers to his
questions, and remained in the room as little as possible.
The Inspector, having refreshed himself, at
his country’s expense, to the very best of his ability—sallied
forth again into the bar, with a general
view, as he would have expressed it, of “keeping
an eye on things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one in the bar; but, glancing
through a side door, Tokely had a view of a very
snug inner room, where three persons were seated,
in the glow of a small fire, very comfortably. One
of these persons was Mrs. Siggs herself; the second,
the black-eyed damsel who had waited upon him;
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>and the third, a man of some sixty years of age,
with a round, jolly, innocent face, half hidden by
an enormous grey beard and moustache, and faintly
illuminated by a pair of sleepy good-tempered blue
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>This man was reading a newspaper, following the
words and sentences in a sort of low comfortable
growl, like the purring of a huge cat by the fire;
Mrs. Siggs was stitching away busily, in a sharp
energetic fashion, which denoted that her temper
had been ruffled; the girl was sitting, with her eyes
pensively fixed on the fire, and her hands clasped
in her lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>The room appeared so very comfortable, and the
Inspector had so clearly made up his mind to devote
the remainder of that day to pleasure, leaving the
more serious business of his visit until the morrow,
that he advanced his head a little into the room,
and enquired whether he might come in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You look so very cosy here, you know,” he
said, “and I’m quite sure you couldn’t be hard on a
lonely man, who has nobody to talk to,” he added,
in an appealing tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Depends a good bit on what you want to talk
about,” said Mrs. Siggs quickly, without glancing
up from her work. “We don’t want no Law ’ere,
my friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who was reading the paper glanced up
mildly, and pushed his chair back a little from the
fire. “Them as comes in the way of trade, my
angel,” he said as slowly and heavily as though he
were spelling the words out of the newspaper in
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>his hand—“’as a right to come where they will, if
so be——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—I dessay,” interrupted Mrs. Siggs, wrathfully.
“W’y don’t you ’ave the ’ole Noah’s Ark in
to tea, w’ile you’re about it, an’ ’am to cut the
bread and butter for ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Inspector Tokely, feeling that he had received as
much encouragement as he was likely to get, passed
into the room, and sat down. After a few moments,
he ventured to suggest a little refreshment
for himself and his host—even delicately hinting
that Mrs. Siggs might be tempted to partake of a
glass at his expense. Mrs. Siggs, relenting a little,
passed into the bar to get what was required; and
the visitor, feeling the necessity for ingratiating
himself as much as possible with them all, turned
to the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mother, I suppose, Miss?” he asked,
edging a little nearer to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl glanced at him for moment—nodded—and
looked again at the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a fine looking mother, too,” went on
Tokely, feeling that it was more uphill work than
he had anticipated. “You, sir”—he turned to the
man with the newspaper—“ought to be proud of
such a wife and daughter.” This at a venture, for
he knew nothing of the relationship they bore to
each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’en I fust drawed near to Betty—t’ other
side the earth—there was a matter of nine men—one
on ’em nigh on to eighty—a makin’ eyes at ’er,
an’ even goin’ so far as to sleep on ’er doorstep. I
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>polished off as many as I could get at, and spoke
words of kind advice (as was throwed away on ’im)
to the old ’un—an’ drove ’er nigh a ’underd mile to
see a parson. An’ she were then as fine a woman—or
finer—than any in them parts.” He laid
down his newspaper—picked it up again—and
finished his remarks. “W’ich so she are now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was at this moment that Betty Siggs came in
from the bar, with a little tray, on which stood
some glasses and a jug of water; but she no sooner
entered the room, than she stopped dead—uttered an
exclamation—and let fall the tray and its contents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inspector Tokely had had his eyes fixed upon
Mr. Siggs, so that he almost faced her as she came
in; yet he could have sworn that, in the half glance
he had of her, she had been looking straight over
his head. Turning swiftly—so soon at least as he
had got out of the way of the flowing liquids—he
saw that, at the spot to which her eyes had been
directed, was a window, partly shrouded by a curtain.
Looking at Mrs. Siggs again, however, he
came reluctantly to the conclusion that he must
have been mistaken; for that excellent woman,
with much laughter at her own carelessness, was
picking up the glasses, and rearranging them on
the tray.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a butter-fingers for you!” she exclaimed.
“Never knowed myself to do that before. It’s
tryin’ to do too much at once; that’s wot it is.
Howsever, it ain’t no use cryin’ over spilt milk—or
spilt spirits; an’ I’m a keepin’ everybody waitin’
for their liquor.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>In a moment, she bustled out again, appearing to
be in a much better temper than before—indeed,
quite desirous of making herself pleasant to every
one, and propitiating the guest as much as possible.
On coming back, she was careful to a nicety about
mixing his drink, and even suggested he should
taste it, to be sure that it was to his liking, before
she proceeded to mix the others. Yet there was
about all her movements a certain fluttering
anxiety which had not been there before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Pon my word, Clara,” she exclaimed suddenly—“I
never see sich a girl in all my days! Fancy
lightin’ up the gas, an’ never drawin’ the curtain
even; wot could you ’ave bin a thinkin’ about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bustled across to the window, and pulled the
curtain sharply across it; yet seemed to look out
of it for a moment, too, the Inspector thought, before
doing so. She came back to her seat—a seat
which faced that window—and gaily pledged the
two men with her glass. But immediately afterwards,
she got up, and moved towards the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Toby, old boy—I wish you’d come and see to
this ’ere tap for a minute,” she called out; and
Toby Siggs got up heavily, and followed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately Inspector Tokely rose also, and
strolled—quite casually, as it seemed—across the
room. Coming to the window, he said—apparently
for the benefit of Clara—“I wonder what sort of
a night it is”—and jerked back the curtain again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Outside the window, however, was nothing but
black darkness; after a moment, the Inspector
turned away, half making up his mind that he must
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>have been mistaken, and resumed his seat. At the
same moment, Mr. and Mrs. Siggs came in, evidently
on the best possible terms with each other,
from the bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, it was a curious thing that Mrs. Siggs, after
one glance at the bared window, made no further
remark about it; nor did Mr. Siggs. Further than
that, Toby Siggs suddenly developed an extraordinary
liking for the Inspector, and a mad desire to
be convivial with him, quite out of keeping with his
general character. For he slapped that respected
man upon the back; forced his glass upon him; ran
out into the bar to fill it himself, the moment it was
empty, insisting that it should be at his expense;
and altogether woke up wonderfully. More than
that, the Inspector, after sipping his renewed glass,
pronounced it to be mighty good stuff—but rather
stronger, he thought, than the last; however, he
drank it, and it seemed to loosen his tongue in an
extraordinary fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>He mentioned—as between friends—that he had
a warrant in his pocket—to be used if necessary—against
a certain person whom he would not name;
proclaimed himself a cautious man; but hinted at
murder, and darkly suggested that a certain person
would find him a remarkably tough fellow to get
over.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Inspector had had his glass replenished for the
fourth time, and was so well pleased with himself,
that he had begun to wag his head, and wink upon
Mrs. Siggs, when another strange thing happened.
Clara, who had been sitting all this time, looking,
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>for the most part, at the fire, and occasionally at
the Inspector, suddenly seemed to cry out; checked
the cry with a fit of hysterical laughter, which may
have been induced by some remark of Tokely’s; and
ran—still laughing in that strange fashion—from
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Inspector, after recovering from the little
shock occasioned by Clara’s behaviour, appeared to
be falling asleep. Betty Siggs, with a watchful eye
upon him, drew nearer to her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Toby,” she whispered breathlessly, stretching
out a hand to draw him towards her, and still keeping
an eye upon Tokely—“’e’s come back again.
Clara must ’ave seed ’im.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t think w’y ’e should be a ’angin’ about
’ere—a shovin’ ’is ’ead into danger like this,” whispered
Toby in reply. “’E’s ’ad a long start—an’
might ’ave bin miles away afore this. W’ere’s Clara
gone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Betty Siggs made a hasty movement with her
hand to silence him; for Tokely was waking up
again. At the same moment, a noise was heard in
the rear of the house, and the next instant a small
door in the further corner of the room was thrust
open, and Harry Routley burst in. He was wild
looking, and in a fearful state of excitement; without
pause, he bounded into the middle of the room,
and faced the astonished Tokely, who had risen hurriedly
to his feet. Betty Siggs must have seen that
in his face which appalled her, for she cried out suddenly,
and covered her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there a man here,” cried Harry, looking round
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>upon them all, “who wants to find the murderer of
Patience Miller?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before any one could speak, and while the energy
of the lad still held them dumb, a figure darted in
at the open doorway, and caught him in its arms,
and fell at his feet. It was Clara Siggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry,” she cried, hiding her face against his
leg, and still clutching him desperately—“for the
love of God, be silent! For the love of all the good
angels—don’t betray him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A sort of fierce struggle seemed to go on, for a
moment, in the lad’s breast; finally, looking down
at her, he stooped, and caught her half roughly by
the arm, and released himself—stepping back a little,
so that she trailed over the floor after him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry! Harry!” was all she said, with a sort
of sob in her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there a man here who wants the murderer
of Patience Miller?” he cried again. “I’ve seen
him, not a moment since; I know which way he’s
gone. I found him talking with this—this girl.
I’ll lead any man to him; I’ll track him down anywhere.
Who wants him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m your man,” cried Tokely, advancing to him,
sobered by the scene he had witnessed. “Who’s
the man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry! Harry!” wailed the girl again, without
rising, or looking up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lad seemed to choke down something in his
throat, before he spoke. “Dandy Chater,” he said,
after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s my man,” cried Tokely, bringing his fist
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>down heavily on the table. “And for a thousand
pounds I’ll have Dandy Chater to-night, before I
sleep! Come on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Catching Harry by the arm, and snatching up his
own hat, he hurried with him out of the still open
door, and vanished in the darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />BETTY SIGGS DREAMS A DREAM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The girl rose slowly from the ground, after the
two men had disappeared, and, still sobbing heavily,
made her way towards the door which led to
the upper part of the house. But her mother,
brought to herself by the movement, advanced rapidly,
and caught her in her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Child,” she said, in a sort of gasp—“this ain’t
no time for callin’ folks names, or talkin’ about
rights and wrongs. Quick—what’s i’ the wind?
I see Master Dandy a lookin’ in at that winder—straight
at me; what’s i’ the wind, child—and w’ere
have they gone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For some moments, Clara Siggs could not speak;
her sobs seemed to shake her from head to foot.
But, after a little time, she grew more calm, and
told what she knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw him—looking in at the window; he beckoned
to me. Then, when I slipped out to him, I
was frightened at first, because he seemed so worn-looking,
and so strange. But he kept saying, again
and again, that he wanted to see you—that he could
not go away, without seeing you. And, in spite of
all they have said, I could not believe, somehow,
when I looked into his eyes, that he could have
done such a cruel and wicked deed as that.” Here
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>her sobs broke out afresh, so that Betty had much
ado to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there—don’t cry, child,” she said. “Crying
never mended any think yet. Wot else did ’e
say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He asked who the man was with us; and, when
I told him, he laughed, and said he would give him
a run for his money, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Spoke like a Chater—that was!” cried Betty,
with considerable pride. “Then wot ’appened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy said that as it wouldn’t be safe
to see you, he would make across the fields, so as
to get clear of Bamberton, and walk on the way to
London. Then, as I was crying, he put his arm
round my shoulders—indeed, indeed, there was no
shame in it, mother dear—and told me not to mind,
for he would clear himself yet. And just at that
moment, I heard a rustling in the hedge, and Harry
jumped through.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Toby Siggs looked long at his daughter; slowly
shook his head; and delivered himself of this piece
of wisdom. “The good Lord, with the willin’ ’elp
of yer mother, made ye fair-lookin’ an’ put bright
eyes into your face; but neither the good Lord nor
your mother meant as ’ow they should be a snare,
or in any way deludin’. One lad is good enough for
the best o’ gels. Go to bed—an’ think well on it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clara, still sobbing, took her way slowly upstairs.
For a long time, Toby Siggs and his wife sat in
whispered conversation; Toby saying but little,
but probably thinking the more. The shadow of
that crime in the wood seemed to have fallen even
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>on that quiet household; Betty Siggs watched the
dying fire; and her mind travelled back, through
the years to the farm in Australia, on the edge of
the Bush, and to the bright-faced lad that cruel
Bush had swallowed up, and snatched from her.
Old Toby Siggs knew the story; for, when first he
had met her, she had had to account for the presence
of the child; but Toby was a silent man, and
the lost boy was as far back in the mists of the dead
years, as in the mists of Toby’s brain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all been a muddle, Toby,” said Mrs. Siggs
at last, still in the same cautious whisper. “If the
old Squire could only know what has happened, I
think ’e’d be a bit sorry ’e cast that boy loose, an’
took up with the younger. Lor’, Toby—wot a boy
’e was!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Toby nodded his head slowly. “Ah!” he ejaculated.
“There ain’t no up-settin’ about me, or about
you, ole gal; we knows ourselves for ordinary folk.
But that boy moved, and talked, and ’eld ’isself like
a gen’leman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That ’e did!” replied Betty, with a vigorous
nod. “Lor’, Toby—if ’e’d ’ave bin at the ’All—we’d
’ave ’ad no talks about pore ruined gals; no
policemen in the ’ouse—no ’untin’ an’ dodgin’ an’
’idin’ like this. God knows ’ow it’s all goin’ to
end, Toby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The house had been shut, so far as its public
capacity was concerned, for some time. Knowing,
however, that the Inspector must presently make
his appearance, and that, in any case, his bed was
reserved for him, Mrs. Siggs and her husband sat
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>on over the fire, each filled with sad thoughts, and
ready, from the events of the evening, for anything
which could happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently there came a heavy knock at the front
door; Mrs. Siggs, with a hand on her ample bosom,
started, and looked appealingly at Toby. That gentleman,
rising with a determined countenance, proceeded
to the door, and flung it open. Exactly
what he was prepared to see, it is impossible to
say; but he was certainly not prepared for the
sight which met his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Out of the darkness there staggered into the
place a solitary figure—that of Inspector Tokely.
His hat was gone—one side of his face was grazed
and bleeding; he was covered with mud and water
almost from head to foot; and his coat was torn
right across one shoulder. Gasping and weary, he
shook a fist in the face of the astonished Toby Siggs,
and snapped out his wrath at that innocent man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You scoundrel!” he shouted—“You infernal
villain! This is all a plot—a conspiracy—you know
it is! I’m lured out of this place, and go racing
and chasing across country—where there are no
street lamps as there ought to be, and no constables
to whistle for. I bark my face against a tree—put
there on purpose, I’ve no doubt, for me to run my
head against; I fall into a ditch, which ought to
have been drained long ago; I lose my hat, which
cost nine-and-sixpence; I tear my coat on a barbed
wire fence, which ought never to have been put up.
And—to crown it all—I lose my prisoner!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Betty Siggs, who had come to the door of the little
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>parlour, suddenly clapped her hands and cried
out—with an exclamation of so much relief, that
the Inspector turned savagely upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Ma’am—laugh—giggle—clap your hands—scream
with joy, Ma’am! I like it—it does me
good! How will <i>you</i> like it, when you appear in
the dock—the dock, Ma’am!—on a charge of aiding
and abetting a prisoner, to escape? What about
windows covered with curtains——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would you ’ave ’em covered with?” retorted
Betty, with a laugh—“wall paper?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, Ma’am—never mind,” retorted
Tokely, viciously. “At the present moment,
Ma’am, I will go to bed. The Law, Ma’am, can
wait. Prepare yourself, Ma’am, for the dock—for
the dock, I say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words, and utterly scornful of Betty
Siggs’s peals of laughter, the Inspector made his
way upstairs to his chamber—leaving a trail of
muddy water to mark his passage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That chap’s done me good!” exclaimed Betty,
wiping her eyes, and turning to Toby, who was
staring in ludicrous amazement after Tokely. “I
just wanted summink to stir me up—I did—an’ that
chap’s done it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You take care, ole gal, that ’e don’t stir <i>you</i>
up,” retorted Toby, shaking his head. “The Law
’as got a ’eap be’ind it—an’ you ain’t got the figger
to be redooced by skilly, nor the fingers for oakum-pickin’.
An’, mark my words, that’s what you’ll
come to, ole gal, if you mocks at the Law!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Betty Siggs, however, was in too good a humour
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>to heed any such warning; she gaily locked up the
house, extinguished the lights and pushed Toby upstairs
to bed. “Blow the Law!” she exclaimed,
kissing him—“You an’ me won’t sleep the less
sound, because the Law ’as got its face scratched,
and lost its ’at—will we, Toby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, Betty’s prediction proved to be, so
far as she was concerned, a false one; sleep refused
to come to her, no matter how she wooed it. Living,
as she always had done, a good brisk hard-working
blameless life, with a conscience as clear as
her own healthy skin, Betty had known nothing of
the terrors of insomnia; yet to-night, she lay
blinking at the stars peeping in through the uncurtained
window, thinking of many things—thinking
most of all, perhaps, of the unhappy man flying for
his life, hiding in ditches and under hedges, and
trembling at every sound. Betty’s tender heart
melted a little when she thought of him, and she
sadly cried herself into a state of quiet exhaustion,
and so fell into a troubled sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in that sleep she dreamed a dream. She was
back again, in the old days, in Australia, at Tallapoona
Farm—the farm which had never paid, and
from which that bright-faced boy Philip had wandered
out one morning, never to return. Yet the
curious part of Betty’s dream was this; that, although
the sights and sounds beyond the windows
were as she had known them over a quarter of a
century ago, the house bore a curious resemblance
to the Chater Arms; indeed, faces familiar to her
later days in Bamberton passed to and fro before
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>the windows, and the slow Bamberton drawl was
in her ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, in her dream, night came swiftly on, and the
place was in darkness. She thought she stood
again in the little parlour alone; and, drawing back
the curtain from before the window, looked out
upon the sandy bridle-tracks, and wild vegetation
which fringed the denser growth beyond. Suddenly,
out of this, and coming straight to the window,
she saw the child, just as she had known him
eighteen long years before. So vivid was the
dream, and so clearly did she see his face, and
recognise it, that—waking with a cry upon her lips—she
found herself out of bed, and standing on the
floor, in the faint light of the stars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Betty Siggs was more troubled than ever. She
looked round the room, as though half expecting to
see her dream realised; rubbed her eyes, and began
to tremble a little. Toby’s regular breathing reassured
her somewhat; but still she felt uneasy.
The window at which she had seen the face of the
man that night, in reality, and the dream-face of
the child, haunted her; she felt that she must go
to it—must assure herself that there was nothing
on the other side of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>She threw a long cloak round her, noiselessly lit
a candle, and crept out of the room. There was no
sound anywhere, save the quick patter of her own
feet on the stairs, and the rapid scurry of a mouse
flying from the light. Betty reached the parlour,
set down her candle, and faced the window, over
which the curtain had been drawn again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>Now, under all the circumstances, it is probable
that ninety-nine people out of a hundred would
have hesitated, at that hour, to draw back that curtain;
and the hundredth would have done it—if at
all—out of sheer bravado. But the curious thing
was, that Betty had no fear of it at all; so completely
was she dominated by her dream, and so
much did she seem to be dreaming still, that she
walked up to the curtain, and softly drew it aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor did she think it strange, under the circumstances,
that there was a face upon the other side;
for, although she believed she looked upon Dandy
Chater, somehow the dream face had got mixed up
with it; the dream-eyes of the child she believed
dead smiled at her, out of the face of the man.
Still keeping her eyes upon the window, she slipped
along to the door and softly drew the bolt, and opened
it; and then—for no known reason, and yet for
some reason which seemed strong within her—began
to tremble very much, as though she faced
something uncanny.</p>

<p class='c009'>A figure moved towards the door, slipped into the
room, and took her in his arms. Not Dandy Chater—not
the man with a price on his head, and blood
on his cruel hands—not the man whose name was
a by-word and a reproach in all that countryside;
but her boy—her dear lad, back from his grave
thousands of miles away! You couldn’t have tried
to deceive old Betty Siggs at that moment; she
knew that no other arms could hold her like that.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, when he called her—as he had done all
those long years before—“little mother”—when
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>he whispered, did she remember Tallapoona Farm,
and the mare with the rat-tail, and Peter the sheep-dog—and
a dozen other things that would have
stamped him as her boy, if nothing else could have
done; old Betty woke from her dream, and burst
into a flood of tears, and laid her old grey head
down on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps it was well that Toby was sleeping
soundly above. For, if <i>he</i> had happened to dream,
and had wandered, in his night apparel, down to
that same parlour, he would have been very properly
scandalised. For here was the supposed Dandy
Chater, sitting near the table, with Betty Siggs—(hugging
him mighty tight round the neck)—on his
knee—the while he rapidly sketched out all that
happened in those eighteen years.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—little mother—little mother!” he said,
drawing her face down, that he might kiss it—“You
didn’t know to whom you were talking,
when I strolled in here the other day, and you read
me a lecture on the sins of Dandy Chater. It’s
been a long time, little mother; picked up, more
dead than alive, by an exploring party in the Bush;
taken with them miles into the interior; then more
miles, by a party bound for the West, with whom
they came in contact. Then, five or six years of
life with a dear old couple, who had no chicks
of their own, and were fond of the friendless boy
thrown on their hands. Then, when I could, I
went back to Tallapoona—only to find that you had
gone to England—no one exactly knew where.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ you kep’ a thought of me all those years—did
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>you, Phil?” whispered the old woman,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—and came back to you as soon as I could.
At least—not to you, because I didn’t know where
you were. But I remembered the story you had
told me; and I knew I had the right to the place
which had been my father’s. But I would not
have turned out my brother; my idea was that we
might live together peaceably, sharing what there
was. But he is dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked round at him, with a startled face;
and he realised, in a moment, that he had given her
the clue to the whole mystery. Therefore, with
much pains and many pauses to allow her to fully
digest the extraordinary story, he told her of the
whole business; of his arrival in England—of his
discovery of the strange likeness between himself
and the real Dandy Chater; and of his determination,
on discovering that his brother was dead, to
trade upon it. Of his certainty that his brother had
been murdered; and of the impossibility of fixing
the crime upon any one’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Betty Siggs saw only with the limited vision
of love; knew only that her boy was with her
again, and that he was innocent of the crime she
had unconsciously laid to his charge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’—this’ll be news for Toby!” she cried;
“this’ll be something to laugh at in the village;
that they’ve taken my boy for Dandy Chater, and
called him names, and ’unted ’im with perlice and
sich like——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop—stop!” he cried, hurriedly. “Not a word
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>of this to a soul, little mother—not a word. Don’t
you see the position in which I stand? My brother
is dead; I have upon me, at the present moment,
his clothes, his papers—his valuables. Good God,
little mother—I’ve traded on his name, and on his
appearance; I’m mixed up in I know not what
shady things concerning him. Turn to any living
soul about here to-night—save yourself—and tell
my story. They will laugh you to scorn; will deride
your boy, who’s come back from the grave.
Don’t you see that their first question would naturally
be—‘If you are not Dandy Chater—you who
wear his clothes, and use his name, and hide by
night, because of his sins—if you are not the man,
where is he?’ And, Heaven help me—what am I
to answer them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Betty Siggs seemed altogether nonplussed, and
could only shake her head. Philip, with his arm
about her, did his best to cheer her up again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come—you mustn’t be down-hearted; I’ll pull
through, somehow or other,” he said. “But, for
the time, I must keep out of the way. Every day
I’m getting nearer to the truth about my brother’s
death; every day I seem to see my way more clearly.
But I don’t want to be accused of his murder—for
they might say, with perfect justice, that I murdered
him, the better to take his place. No—I want
to track down the real man; when that time comes,
I’ll call on you to speak. Until then, you must be
silent as the grave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t—I can’t!” cried Betty Siggs. “Is my
dear boy to come back to me, after all these years—and
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>am I to see ’im ’unted an’ drove like this
’ere, by a mere common Tokely—an’ say nothink?
Not me!” Betty Siggs folded her arms, and
nodded her head with much determination.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little mother—little mother!” he exclaimed—“do
you want to ruin me? Do you want to undo
all that I have tried so hard to bring about? Shall
I tell you something more?—something to be
hidden deep in that good heart of yours, and never
breathed to any one? Betty—you don’t mind my
calling you Betty—do you?—have you ever been
in love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’raps you’d like to ask Toby, as is a snorin’ ’is
’ead off upstairs this very minute,” retorted Mrs.
Siggs, with a very becoming blush. “In love,
indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well then, you will understand my difficulty.
<i>I’m</i> in love, little mother—and with the sweetest
girl in all the world. But even in that, my ill-luck
dogs me; for she believes that her lover is Dandy
Chater, whom she has known for years; if she once
heard that she had whispered her words of love
and tenderness and sympathy to a stranger—do
you think that she would look at me again? Little
mother—it’s the maddest thing in the world; because,
if she has any regard for me as Dandy
Chater, she knows me for everything that’s bad and
vile—food only for the common hangman; while, on
the other hand, as Philip Chater I am a stranger,
and farther from her than ever. In any case, it is
hopeless; yet, knowing that whatever sympathy
she has is given to Dandy Chater, I’ll be Dandy
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>Chater to the end—whatever that end may be.
And even you, little mother, shall not change that
purpose. So don’t talk about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She recognised—however unwillingly—that what
he said was true; although she cried a little—partly
for love of him, partly in terror at his danger—she
yet was comforted by the feeling that all the sad
years of mourning were swept away, and that the
boy she had reared and loved had fulfilled her most
sanguine expectations and had grown to the manhood
she had pictured for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He got up, and took her tenderly in his arms
again, to say good-bye. “It won’t be long, little
mother,” he said, “before I come again to you, and
take my place in my father’s home. But, for the
present, I want you to swear to me—to swear to
me on something you love well—that you will not
betray my secret. Betty—for the love of your boy—swear
to me that you will not betray me—will
not take from me the love of the woman who is more
to me than anything else in the wide world. Swear
to me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With tears in her honest old eyes, she drew his
head down, and kissed him. “I’ll swear to you,
Phil,” she said—“by that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ran out into the darkness, and left her standing,
in the light of the candle, in the little parlour.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />THE SHADY ’UN AS A MORAL CHARACTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It must be confessed that Mr. Ogledon—better
known, in some shady circles, as “The Count”—was
in an awkward situation. For a whole week,
he had secretly congratulated himself on the fact
that his unfortunate cousin Dandy Chater was
safely out of the way; moreover, he had carefully
rehearsed the part he was to play, when first told
of Dandy’s disappearance; had decided how best to
show his pain and indignation, and his determination
to hunt down the mystery, and find the murderer.
In a word, he had carefully arranged so
that no possible suspicion should fall upon himself;
and now he discovered—to his consternation—that
all these precautions were unnecessary, and that
some ghastly replica of the murdered man had
taken his place, and was accepted, by all and
sundry as the genuine man. It must be said at
once, that Ogledon, having no knowledge of the
real story, and goaded by his own guilty conscience,
found no solution in his mind of the mystery in any
practical form. He saw, in this creature who had
sprung up in the likeness of the man whose life had
been brutally beaten out of him, only something
horrible and intangible, come straight from the
Land of Shadows, to mock at him, and drive him to
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>distraction. If, on that lonely river bank, at the
dead of night, the victim he had struck down lifeless
had suddenly risen up in full vigour, unharmed
and smiling, the murderer could not have been
more appalled than he was by this quiet acceptance,
by every one, of the figure which had stared
through the window at him from the terrace of
Chater Hall. Never for an instant suspecting the
presence of the second man, that solution of the
mystery did not occur to him; he saw in this
Dandy Chater, risen from the grave, only his own
embodied conscience, come to haunt and terrify
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He remained that night in the dining-room with
the Doctor; fearing to go to bed, or to be left alone
for a moment. And, as the Doctor, whenever he
got the opportunity, applied himself assiduously to
the consumption of neat brandy, Mr. Ogledon as
the time drew on towards morning, found himself
pretty fully occupied in shaking his companion, and
keeping him awake.</p>

<p class='c009'>But day had its terrors, too; for the first person
who entered the room made a casual and innocent
enquiry concerning “Master Dandy,” and when he
might be expected. Ogledon, dismissing this man
with an oath, turned to the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cripps,”—he shook the little man, for perhaps
the hundredth time, the better to impress his meaning
upon him—“Cripps—I’m going to make a bolt
for it. I must get away, for a time, until this thing
has blown over, and been forgotten. I shall go mad,
if I stay here——Well—what do <i>you</i> want?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>This last was addressed to a servant, who had entered
the room. The man informed him that a Mr.
Tokely—connected, he believed, with the police—wished
to see him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon grasped the back of a chair, and turned
a ghastly face towards Cripps. Telling the man to
show the visitor in, he turned to Cripps, when they
were alone together again, and spoke in a frightened
hurried whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stand by me, Cripps—stand by me, and back
me up,” he said. “Ask what you will of me afterwards—only
stand by me now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cripps had the greatest possible difficulty, in
his then condition, to stand by himself; but he
feebly murmured his intention to shed his blood for
his friend. And at that moment Tokely came in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, in the stress of more personal matters,
Ogledon had paid but little attention to the disjointed
remarks of Mrs. Dolman, concerning the
murder in the wood; and the subject had, by this
time, gone clean out of his mind. Indeed, but one
subject—a deadly fear for his own safety—occupied
his mind at this time; so that it will readily be understood
that the first words uttered by the Inspector
were startling in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Inspector was not in the best of tempers, and
was in no mood to be trifled with. He came in
rapidly, closed the door and advanced towards
Ogledon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, sir,” he began, “I don’t want you to compromise
yourself about this matter; but business is
business, and the Law is the Law. Touching this
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>matter of Mr. Dandy Chater—this matter of murder——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He got no further; as Ogledon, with a cry, turned
swiftly, and made towards the door—Tokely turning,
too, in his astonishment—Dr. Cripps, dimly
and drunkenly realising that his patron was in danger,
caught up the nearest weapon, which happened
to be a heavy decanter, and, with a shrill scream,
hurled himself upon the Inspector, and brought the
decanter down with all his force upon that gentleman’s
head. The unfortunate officer, with a groan,
dropped flat, and lay motionless.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment or two, Ogledon stood staring
down at him, scarcely knowing what to do—while
Cripps, mightily pleased with his performance,
danced all round Tokely’s prostrate form, waving
the decanter, and chanting a species of dirge. But,
the seriousness of the position dawning rapidly
upon Ogledon, he seized Cripps by the arm,
wrenched the decanter from his grasp, and buffetted
him into a sense of the enormity of his offence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You idiot!” he whispered, hoarsely—“a pretty
thing you’ve done now. I might have stood and
braved the thing out; there’s no proof against me—and
suspicions are useless. But now, after this,
there’s nothing for it but to make a bolt of it!—I
suppose it’s my own fault, for having anything to
do with a drunken little worm like yourself.
Quick!—there’s no time to be lost; we must clear
out of this. Come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Going to the door, he listened cautiously for a
few moments, and then swiftly opened it. There
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>was no one in sight, and he darted across the hall,
and caught up his own and the Doctor’s hats and
coats, and went back noiselessly. Tokely still lay
without movement; and Ogledon dragged Cripps
into his coat, and crammed his shabby hat on his
head; put on his own outdoor things, and prepared
to leave the place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, attend to me,” he said to Cripps. “I
shall lock this door on the inside, and take the key
with me; we’ll go through this window on to the
terrace. If this fellow ever wakes again—of which
I am extremely doubtful—it won’t be for an hour
or so; and that will give us a fair start. Now—come
quietly. This has been a devilish unlucky
night, and it promises to be an unlucky day. I
thought myself so safe; I don’t like the turn things
have taken at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Strolling quietly, until they were out of sight of
the windows of the house, the two got clear away—Ogledon
keeping a tight grip of the arm of his
swaying companion. Indeed, it is possible that,
before many hours had elapsed, the little man
deeply regretted the part he had played in the recent
adventure; for Ogledon walked him on, without
mercy, mile after mile, and without paying the
slightest attention to his many piteous entreaties to
be allowed to pause at seductive-looking public-houses,
for rest and refreshment. Later in the day,
they came to a small station, within easy distance
of London; and—dusty, weary, foot-sore, and ill-tempered,
Cripps was glad to get into the corner of
a third-class railway-carriage, and fall asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>Arrived at the terminus, Ogledon coolly announced
to his companion that they must part. “I
shall drive across London—get some dinner—and
catch the night express for the Continent. You will
not, in all probability, hear from me for some time.
Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what—what is to become of me?” asked
the little man, in dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure I don’t know—and I’m equally sure I
don’t care,” responded Ogledon. “You’ve got
yourself and me into this trouble; I’m going to
get out of it—you had better do the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’ve no money,” said Cripps, appealingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—you should have thought of that before
knocking policemen on the head with decanters.
If you will be so giddy and youthful and frolicsome,
you must take the consequences. Good-bye again;
I hope they won’t catch you!” He turned and
made his way out of the station; Cripps saw him
jump into a cab, and disappear in the press of
traffic in the streets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime, another traveller—a fugitive like himself—had
set his face in the same direction; with
no settled purpose in his mind, save to hide, until
such time as he could formulate a plan of action.
Not daring to trust to the railway, lest his description
should have been telegraphed, and men should
be on the lookout for him, Philip Chater had started
off to walk to London. Coming, long after the sun
was up, into a straggling suburb, which yet had
some faint touches of the country left upon it, he
sat down, outside a small public-house, on a bench—ordered
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>some bread and cheese and ale—and ate
and drank ravenously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” he muttered to himself, with a little
laugh—“yesterday was a busy day. We start with
a burglary, and with the fact that Arthur Barnshaw
has discovered me in a forgery, and—so he believes—in
an attempt to steal his sister’s diamond necklace.
Compared with what has gone before, these
things are mere trifles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He laughed again, took a pull at his beer, and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me see—what happened after that? Oh,
to be sure; I went round, to try and have a word
with old Betty; I hated the thought that she—dear
little mother of the old days—should think so badly
of me. I felt that I could trust her to keep my
secret, if necessary. Then, after waiting about for
a long time, that girl—(Clara—Harry called her)—came
out, to tell me that the strange man I had
seen through the window was from London, and
probably held a warrant for my arrest. And then
that jealous idiot Harry, must jump in, and come
scouring over the country after me with the policeman
in tow. Well, I got away that time at all
events.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He sat for some time, with a musing smile upon
his face, stirring the dust at his feet with the toe of
his boot. At the moment, he had clean forgotten
the danger which threatened him, or the necessity
for further flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear little mother!” he whispered—“how glad
she was to see me; how glad to know that her boy
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>had come back again. I’m glad I went back to the
place, after the policeman gave up the chase as
hopeless. Heigho—I suppose I must be moving——Hullo—what
the devil do you want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some one had stopped before him—some one
with remarkably old and broken boots. Raising
his eyes rapidly upwards to the face of the owner
of the boots, Philip Chater gave a start of surprise
and dismay. The Shady ’un—looking a little more
disreputable than usual—stood before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Going rapidly over in his mind the events of the
past few days, Philip Chater tried to discover, in
the few moments the Shady ’un stood silently
regarding him, whether or not he was to look upon
that interesting gentleman as a friend, or as a foe.
Remembering the two encounters with Captain
Peter Quist—the scene in the upper room at “The
Three Watermen”—and the unwarrantable liberty
taken with the Shady ’un’s headgear on that
occasion, for the extinguishing of the light—Philip
decided that the man had reason to be resentful.
Accordingly, he waited for an attack—verbal or
otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Shady ’un—for some reason of his own—was
disposed to be friendly; feeling, perhaps, a
certain warming of his heart towards one in misfortune—a
brother in criminality, as it were—he
turned a smiling face towards Philip Chater, and
held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This ’ere is the ’and of a pal—an ’umble pal, if
yer like—but still a pal. Strike me pink!” exclaimed
the Shady ’un, in a sort of hoarse whisper—“but
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>w’en it comes ter bread and cheese fer swells
like Dandy—wot are we a comin’ to; I would arks”—he
flung out one grimy hand, in an appeal to the
Universe—“I would arks—wot are we bloomin’
well comin’ to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—it looks bad—doesn’t it?” replied Philip,
still with a wary eye upon the other. “But one
must take what the gods send—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—they sends me a dry throat, an’ nuffink
to wet it with,” said the Shady ’un, dismally eyeing
the beer which stood on the bench beside Philip,
with a thirsty tongue rolling round his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—I dare say we can remedy that,” responded
Philip. “Go inside, and get what you
want, and bring it out here; I should like to talk to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shady ’un immediately vanished through the
doorway, and was heard inside, explaining that his
“guv’nor” would pay “the damage.” In a few
moments, he emerged, bearing a tankard, and some
bread and cheese; seated himself on the bench, and
fell to with an appetite.</p>

<p class='c009'>He disposed of his breakfast—if one may so
describe it—at an astonishing rate; wiped his
pocket-knife on his leg; and looked round, with
a smirk which was probably intended as an expression
of gratitude, at Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tork away, guv’nor,” he said, with a glance
towards the open door of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First,” said Philip—“tell me how you come to
be here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They took me, at the last moment, for that ’ere
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>little job at Bamberton—the job of the di’monds.
You was in that, Dandy—wasn’t yer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes—I was in it,” replied Philip. “So I
suppose that you—like myself—are making your
way towards London?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other nodded. “The word was passed for
us to scatter; an’ I’ve bin a scatterin’ all the
bloomin’ night—I ’ave. I must ’ave bin close on
yer ’eels most of the time, Dandy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long and somewhat awkward silence
between the two. Philip was debating in his mind
as to how much to tell the Shady ’un, and how much
to leave unsaid. The Shady ’un, for his part, having
heard gathering rumours of that business in the
wood, eyed his companion somewhat stealthily, and
worked out a plan of action in his own fertile
brain. He broke silence at last, by coming at the
matter in what he thought a highly diplomatic
manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beastly noosance—gels,” he said—staring hard
before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked Philip, glancing at
him in some perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shady ’un drew a deep breath, and shook his
head. “There you go!” he exclaimed, with considerable
disgust. “No confidence—no trust—no
confidin’ spirit about yer! Didn’t I say, a week
ago, as you might come ter the Shady ’un, wiv a
open ’eart an’ ’and; that ’e was the friend, if ever
the Count should fail yer! Strike me pink!” cried
the Shady ’un, with much earnestness—“did I say
them words—or did I not?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>“I believe you said something of the kind,” replied
Philip, after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Course I did,” said the Shady ’un, energetically.
“An’ wot I said I sticks to. They calls me the
Shady ’un; but I was c’ristened  ‘Shadrach’—an’
’ad a faver of the name of Nottidge. The Shady ’un
may not be all as ’e should be; but Shadrach Nottidge
is a pal, an’ a friend. Dandy, my boy—there’s
’emp-seed sowed for you—an’ well you
knows it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip glanced round at him quickly, but said
nothing. The Shady ’un drank some beer slowly,
looking over the top of the tankard, and winked
one eye with much solemnity. Setting down the
beer, he ventured to lay one hand on Philip’s arm.
“Yer ain’t treated me quite fair, Dandy—but I
bears no malice,” he said, in the same hoarse
whisper as before. “I ’ave bin chivvied by a pal o’
yourn—I ’ave bin knocked into a shop by that same
pal—I ’ave ’ad a many things done wot ain’t
strictly on the square. But I bears no malice, an’
I’m ready to ’elp yer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There seemed so much sincerity about the man,
and Philip was so desperately in need of assistance
at that time, that he resolved to confide in him.
After all, he thought, the man knew the worst, and
knew in how many other shady transactions Dandy
Chater had been mixed up; to confirm his friendship
would perhaps, after all, be a matter of policy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then—understand this,” he said abruptly—“I’m
flying for my life. There’s a warrant out
against me for murder——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>The Shady ’un nodded comfortably. “I know—I
know,” he said; “young gel—very much in the
way—you ’its ’er a clump—say by axerdent. She
don’t like it—an’ just to spite yer—goes dead. Lor’—that
ain’t nuffink; might ’appen to a man any
day. But I suppose the splits is out—an’ Dandy
must make ’isself scarce?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—that’s about it,” replied Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shady ’un got up, and shook himself, with an
air of resolution. “It’s a lucky fing I came acrost
yer so ’andy,” he said. “You’d ’ave got nabbed in
no time. The Shady ’un’s yer pal; stick to ’im—an’
all will be well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In his desperate extremity, Philip made up his
mind to trust the man. By strange courts and
alleys, and by unfrequented thoroughfares, they
came at last to a wretched lodging, in the neighbourhood
of the Borough—a lodging which appeared
to be the private retreat of the Shady ’un in
his hours of leisure. There, Philip Chater, utterly
worn out, was glad to fling himself on a wretched
bed, and fall asleep instantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some minutes after he had begun to slumber,
the other man stood looking down upon him, with
an evil smile crossing his face; he even shook his
fist at him once—bringing it so near to the sleeper’s
head, that it was a matter for wonder that he did
not actually hit him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a good chance fer me—this ’ere,”
whispered the Shady ’un to himself. “Nice chap
you are—to give yerself airs, an’ git yer pals to
bang me about—ain’t yer? This little bit of business
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>may stand me in all right, if I gets into
trouble on me own. Yes—Dandy—I’ll make sure
of you, right away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shady ’un—after assuring himself that Philip
was sleeping heavily—left the place, and bent his
steps in a direction they would not willingly have
taken on any other occasion—to a police-station.
Within a very little time, messages had flashed to
and fro upon the wires; questions had been asked
and answered; and a silent and taciturn sergeant,
accompanied by a couple of constables, went back
with the Shady ’un to his lodging.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip, waking from an uneasy sleep, saw the grim
faces—the blue coats—the helmets of the Law; and
knew that the game was up. The Shady ’un—after
being quite sure that he was secured—drew near.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These gents know me—an’ they knows as ’ow
I’ve ’ad my little bit of trouble afore to-day. But
my ’ands—look at ’em, gents, I beg of yer—my
’ands is free from blood—an’ sich-like wickedness.
Gents—if ever the time should come w’en, for
dooty’s sake, you should ’ave to be ’ard on me—you’ll
remember this in my favour—won’t yer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes—we’ll remember it,” responded the
taciturn sergeant. “Come, Mr. Dandy Chater—we
are quite ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Late that night, Bamberton was stirred to its
depths again, by the news that Mr. Dandy Chater
was in close custody in the lock-up, with a special
draft of constables to keep watch over him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />WHO KILLED THIS WOMAN?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Bamberton was taking grim holiday. Bamberton
the sleepy—with nothing to stir it, from one
dreary year’s end to the other, treading its dull respectable
round, knowing exactly who married who,
and how John This, or James That, got on with
their respective wives, with the certainty of the dull
little clock in the Chater Arms—had suddenly
awakened to find itself notorious, and its name in
big print in the great London papers. Moreover,
had not Bamberton, the newly-awakened, already
had pictures of its High Street (with an impossible
man, in a smock-frock, leaning on a species of
clothes-prop, in the foreground) in the illustrated
and evening journals? Had not Bamberton already
been photographed, interviewed, stared at, and made
public in a hundred different ways. Now, too, had
come the day of the inquest; and impossible rumours
were already in the air, concerning that same
inquest, and the marvellous things which were to
be said and done thereat. Scarcely to be wondered
at therefore, is it, that Bamberton should be taking
grim holiday, and should be flocking to the place
where twelve lucky members of its male community
had been summoned to give judgment, concerning
the doing to death of poor Patience Miller.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>At a period long since forgotten, some charitable
inhabitant, or other person interested in the welfare
of the male and female youth of Bamberton, had
had dreams of an Institute; and, with that laudable
design in view, had pounced upon the only unoccupied
spacious building in the locality, and had endeavoured
to transform it into a Hall of semi-dazzling
Light. The attempt had been a failure; and
the building—which was no other than the old Mill,
which stood on the outskirts of the wood—had long
since fallen into greater decay than before.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this place had again come before the public
notice, by reason of the fact that the body of the
murdered girl had been carried there, after its discovery;
and at that place the inquest was to be
held. The body had been put in an upper room—a
species of loft; the inquest was to be held
in the great room of the Mill, where certain
iron rings and rotting ropes—part of an abortive
attempt at a gymnasium—hung suggestively from
the ceiling. And thither all Bamberton bent its
steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whisperings, and murmurings, and the shuffling
of many feet—with some glances towards the ceiling,
as though curious eyes would pierce through,
and see the ghastly thing laid above. At present,
only a grave-faced country constable or two, setting
chairs in order for the twelve lucky men, the Coroner,
and the witnesses; and exercising a little brief
authority, in keeping back certain Bambertonites
who were pressing forward beyond the limits assigned
for the general public. Once or twice, the
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>door of a smaller room opened, and an important-looking
little man, with a hard face and a tuft of
hair on his chin, came bustling out, with a little
sheaf of papers in his hand, to whisper to one or other
of the constables. The door of that room proved to
be a keen source of attraction to many eyes; for it
was whispered that the prisoner waited within.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After what seemed an interminable length of
time, a little gentleman, in a black frock-coat, thrust
his way with some impatience through the general
public, and made his way to one end of the table set
apart in the cleared space. A murmur ran round
that this was the Coroner, from the neighbouring
county-town; murmurs, also, that he did not quite
look the part, inasmuch as that he wore an air of
cheerfulness, which seemed almost to suggest that
he was about to preside at a wedding, rather than
at anything so formidable as an inquest.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little glancing at his watch by this gentleman;
an expostulatory whisper or two on his part to the
constables in attendance, and the door of the inner
room opened again, and Inspector Tokely came
bustling out. One constable—a stranger to Bamberton,
and of more importance on that account,
produced a list, from which, with a strong provincial
accent, he proceeded to call out certain names.
Then, more shuffling of feet, and some friendly
pushing of bashful jurymen forward, and the twelve
ranged themselves sheepishly, with much coughing,
round the table, and were duly sworn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be seated, gentlemen, I beg,” said the Coroner,
busy with his papers. “Stop one moment, though”—glancing
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>up quickly—“have you viewed the
body?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Several of the jurymen present expressed a decided
disinclination to do anything of the kind;
and it became apparent that that important ceremony
had not been performed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, Moody,” exclaimed the Coroner—“this
is most remiss on your part. This should have
been done first of all. We are wasting time—valuable
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The repentant Mr. Moody—the strange constable—made
some attempt at an apology, and concluded
by hurrying the jurymen through another door,
where they were heard to go heavily up wooden
stairs, and to tramp about a little overhead. In
the meantime, the Coroner had a word or two with
Inspector Tokely, and glanced once or twice, with
a nod, towards the door where the prisoner was
supposed to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>The jurymen coming down again—some of them
rather white-faced and wide-eyed—the Coroner abruptly
motioned them to their seats, and turned to
Tokely as he took his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Inspector, I think we may have Mr. Chater in
here now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The general public seemed to stir and sway, as
though bent by a sudden wind; bending towards
each other, and whispering hoarsely, yet keeping
their eyes with one accord turned towards that
door. Inspector Tokely hurried out, and came
back in another moment, glancing over his shoulder
through the doorway; immediately following
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>him came Philip Chater, with two constables in
close attendance. He looked round for a moment
at the murmuring crowd; seemed to seek one face
in it, and to smile as he recognised it. At the same
moment, a woman in the crowd burst into violent
weeping.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Coroner rapped the table impatiently with
his knuckles. “Any demonstration on the part of
any member of the public will necessitate my clearing
the room at once,” he said, looking sternly
about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the jurymen—no other than old Toby
Siggs—rose ponderously in his place. “Askin’ yer
pardon, Mister,” he said, slowly—“I rather think
as ’ow that was my ole gel.” Then, before the
astonished Coroner could interpolate a remark,
Toby turned abruptly, and addressed his spouse.
“’Earty is it, ole gel,” he said, in a voice like
muffled thunder, for her special hearing—“we’ll
git ’im off, afore you’d ’ave time to draw ’arf a pint.
Bear in mind, ole gel, as ’ow I’ve got a vote.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My good sir,” interposed the Coroner, hurriedly,—“let
me impress upon you that this business must
be tried judicially and fairly—with no bias. Understand
that clearly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Toby nodded his head with much gravity. “Sich
are my intentions, Mister,” he said. “So fire away
as ’ard as you like. An’ Gawd ’elp the winner!”
With which pious exclamation, Toby Siggs sat down
perfectly satisfied with himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now the Coroner—in a quick, bustling fashion,
as though he were in a hurry, and should be
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>glad to get so unimportant a matter off his hands—began
to inform the jury of what their clear duty
was, and how rapidly they might set about it. The
body of this young girl, gentlemen, had been found
in the adjacent wood. She was stabbed very near
a vital part, and had undoubtedly, under considerable
pain, and for a period perhaps of half-an-hour,
slowly bled to death. They would be told—by the
medical gentleman then present—who had made a
most careful post-mortem examination of the body—that
the wound could not have been self-inflicted.
Such being the case, gentlemen, it devolved upon
them to discover in what fashion her death had
been caused; and here he would remind them that
they must be guided entirely by circumstantial evidence.
A man—a gentleman of good position—appeared
before them that day, in a most unenviable
situation. It was not for him, gentlemen, to tell
them of their duty, or to lead them to imagine that
any guilt attached to the man they saw before
them; all that they must judge for themselves.
But they would be confronted with witnesses—most
unwilling witnesses—who would tell them of
the intimacy which had undoubtedly existed between
this man and the murdered girl; they would
be told, gentlemen, by a witness from the railway
station, of the appearance of this man, in a great
state of excitement and hurry, at the station, in
time—barely in time, gentlemen, to catch the last
train to London. This, too, on the very night of
the murder, and within a very short time of the
hour at which, according to the medical testimony
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>they would hear, this unfortunate young woman
must have been struck down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the Coroner stopped to clear his throat, and
to glance at Philip Chater—as though to assure
that unfortunate man that he was quite prepared
to put a rope round his neck within the next few
minutes, and had already got it half spun.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentlemen of the jury, who surely knew
their duties, would be told how this man, deserting
his home, had fled to London; how he had come
back, in the dead of night, and had been seen about
the village; how a most intelligent officer—a gentleman
from Scotland Yard, gentlemen—had endeavoured
to capture him; how he had again fled
to London. They would be told, by a former associate
of this man—now very repentant of his
connection with him—of a sort of semi-confession
made by this man to him. More than all, they
would hear that a spade had been discovered near
the body, which had evidently been used in a hurried
attempt to dig a grave for the murdered girl
(the crowd swayed again, like an angry sea and
one woman shrieked out something unintelligible
against the man who stood so calmly through it all)—and
that spade would be traced as having come
from the residence of the man now before them.
While admitting, gentlemen, that all this evidence
was purely circumstantial, the Coroner must beg
them not to cast it lightly aside on that account,
but to hear the witnesses with patience. And so
sat down, having spun his rope to a tolerable length
and strength.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>Marshalled by Tokely, the first witnesses were
already shuffling to their places, when an interruption
came from among the crowd; and a young
man thrust himself forward, and made straight for
the Coroner. He was a bright-faced fellow, with a
cool and gentlemanly bearing, and he gave a quick
nod to Philip as he pressed forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One moment, Mr. Coroner,” he said. “Mr.
Chater here is an old friend of mine—knew him at
Oxford. I’m a barrister; and I claim the right to
represent Mr. Chater at these proceedings. I should
like to point out to you, Mr. Coroner”—still with
the same engaging frankness, and the same cheery
smile—“that my friend is placed in a very awkward
position, and has against him, in charge of the
case, a very able representative of the law”—a bow
here for the gratified Inspector—“from Scotland
Yard. I merely propose to watch the case on behalf
of my friend, and to put such questions as I
may deem necessary, and as you, Mr. Coroner, may
see fit, in the exercise of a wise discretion, to
allow.” Here the young gentleman bowed all
round again, with another cheery smile, and sat
down near the Coroner, after having made a decidedly
good impression.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater broke the silence which seemed to
hang so heavily about him, and addressed the Coroner.
“I am greatly obliged,” he said, “for my
friend’s kindly offer; but I would rather decline it.
Whatever case there is against me must go on its
merits; I desire nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the Coroner, or any one else, could speak,
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>the young gentleman came darting out of his chair,
and had Philip by the button-hole—drawing him
aside a little, and impressing his points upon him in
an eager whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear boy,” he said, with the same
frankness as before—“don’t you be foolish. Frankly—I
believe you to be innocent; but these beggars
don’t—and you’ll get yourself into a devil of a hole,
and give yourself away most gloriously, if you try
to conduct the case yourself. This chap from Scotland
Yard is an ass—but he’s vindictive; the Coroner
is in a hurry, and is dead against you. On
the other hand—have the goodness to consider my
position. This is my first chance—absolutely my
first. I’ve read up the case, day by day, and I
know it by heart; I may do you a lot of good—and
I shall make my own fortune. To-morrow morning
in all the newspapers—Andrew Banks—rising
young barrister—badgered the Coroner—turned the
witnesses inside out—played Old Harry with the
police; don’t you see? Now—all you have to do
is to sit quiet, and look virtuous; I’ll lay out Mr.
Coroner, for the benefit of the yokels, in a brace of
shakes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was gone again, back to his place at the table,
before Philip Chater had even time to thank him,
or to remonstrate further; and the real business of
the inquest began. In the first place, appeared the
two countrymen who had found the body; and who
contradicted each other in minor points of detail,
and were hopelessly confused by that rising young
barrister Mr. Andrew Banks—so much so, that, at
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>the end of five minutes, they were half disposed to
believe that the one had committed the murder, and
the other made an attempt to hide the body. And
so sat down, greatly confused.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next came Betty Siggs—making a deeper impression
than she would willingly have done against
the man who stood watching her. For, after a
question or two, old Betty turned suddenly to that
quiet figure, and stretched out her hands, and appealed
to him, in a voice shaken by sobs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For God’s sake—let me speak; let me tell what
I know,” she said; and, though she spoke in a
whisper, the silence about her was so deep and
solemn that the lightest breath of that whisper was
heard. “For the sake of the old days—let me say
what you and I alone know—let me—my dear—my
dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Unfortunately, it had the very opposite effect to
that which Betty intended; for there seemed to be
at once established between these two some terrible
affinity in the crime, which made it more horrible.
Nor did the young barrister improve matters; for,
wholly at a loss to understand to what she referred
he began to urge her to tell all she knew—even to
threaten her with dire penalties, in the event of
non-compliance.</p>

<p class='c009'>But that only made matters worse; she cast one
swift look in the direction of Philip, and read in his
face that she must be silent; turned on the young
and ardent man of law—and defied him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you think, young man—as you’re agoin’
to open my mouth—because you ain’t. I loved this
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>poor young gel, as though she’d been a child o’ my
own; but I swear to you, before God, that the man
who stands there knew nothing of it, and is absolutely
innocent. Toby—my angel—vote for ’im—if
you love me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Toby answered with a responsive growl, and
Mrs. Siggs sat down. Nor would the pleadings of
the Coroner—the threats of Tokely—or the suavity
of the young barrister move her; she read in the
face from which she took her inspiration that she
must be silent—and the rack itself would not have
moved her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Came the medical man, who gave his evidence
grimly enough, in technical terms which yet sent a
shudder through the listening crowd. He had examined
the body, and, in answer to a question from
the Coroner, gave it as his opinion—and with certainty—that
the unfortunate girl, at the time of her
death was near the period when she would have
given birth to a child; struck a more deadly blow
at the prisoner, by describing, in callous medical
phraseology, the wound which had been inflicted,
and the lingering death which followed. At the end
of that evidence, there was not a man nor woman in
the place that would not have shrieked “Murderer!”
at him, whatever the verdict of the jury
might be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some little sensation was created by the appearance
of Harry Routley, the young servant of Dandy
Chater; who—tackled by the Inspector, and keeping
his eyes resolutely turned from the man whose
life he was swearing away, gave his evidence in
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>little more than monosyllables; but gave it in
damning quality enough, even at that. Some
greater sensation, too, was caused, by his turning
swiftly to the prisoner, in the midst of the questions
of the Inspector, and holding out his hands to
Philip in an agony of appeal; and then covering
his face with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Dandy—Master Dandy!” he cried—“I
swore to you that I would keep the secret—I have
broken my word! Master Dandy—I was mad—beside
myself—Master Dandy—forgive me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It created, if that were possible, a worse impression
than ever. In the midst of the murmurs
which surged up about them, the quiet voice of
Philip was heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all right, Harry; you’ve only done the
right thing. The time will come when you will
understand better what I mean—when you will
have no cause for regret. You need have none
now; you have been more loyal and true to me
than I deserved; I say it openly, before all here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Came Inspector Tokely himself, demanding that
this man be sent for trial; pointing out this man’s
desperate attempts to escape; his partial success;
and so introducing the last witness—the Shady ’un.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shady ’un—giving his name, with much humility,
as Shadrach Nottidge—threw himself upon
the mercy of the gentlemen present. He was but
an ’umble workin’ man—led astray by the villainies
of Mr. Chater. In a moment of remorse, he had
felt that Mr. Chater must be given up; he could
not have slept in peace, good gentlemen, while Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>Chater remained at large. Mr. Chater had told
him that he was flying for his life; had begged him
(the Shady ’un) to give him shelter. Declining to
allow his white hands to be soiled—even by deputy—with
blood, he had taken the earliest opportunity
of handing Mr. Chater over to the Law. And he
hoped it would be remembered in his favour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Andrew Banks—rising young barrister of
the cheery smile—tried his hardest—badgered the
Coroner—twitted Inspector Tokely—was sarcastic
with the Shady ’un; but all to no purpose. The
Coroner very clearly pointed out to the jury their
obvious duty in this matter; reminded them that
Law and Justice took no cognizance of a man’s social
position; and generally spun his rope a little
stronger. Finally, addressing Philip, begged to
know if he cared to make any statement, administering
to him, at the same time, the usual legal
caution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have nothing to say—except that I am wholly
innocent of this murder,” said Philip, quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rest was a mere matter of form. The jury
returned a verdict of Wilful Murder, against Mr.
Dandy Chater, of Chater Hall, in the County of
Essex; and he was duly committed to take his trial
at the coming Sessions at the county-town. Toby
Siggs made some faint protest, but was overruled;
and the crowd surged out into the spring sunshine,
and generally expressed the opinion that Dandy
Chater was as good as hanged already.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />CLARA FINDS A LODGING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On the morning following that verdict of Wilful
Murder, some one was astir very early at the Chater
Arms; some one dressed hurriedly, while the dawn
was yet breaking; some one crept softly down the
stairs—pausing for a moment at one door, and
seeming to catch her breath in a sob—and so went
cautiously out of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Clara Siggs. But not the Clara Siggs of
old; not the bright-eyed impudent little beauty,
ready for a dozen coquetries—willing to exchange
smiling glances with any good-looking lad who
passed her. Quite another person was the Clara
Siggs who went swiftly down the village street this
morning, with a resolute purpose in her black eyes;
so much had one night changed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She hurried on, for a time, resolutely enough,
until she was almost clear of the village. The
houses were closed; in one window which she
passed, a faint light—burning perhaps in some sick-chamber—seemed
to bid scant defiance to the coming
day, and crave that the night might be longer.
But there was no sign of life anywhere else; the
village might have been a place of the dead, for all
the life there was about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At a certain point on the road, her steady resolution
seemed to falter; she hesitated—walked more
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>slowly—and finally stopped altogether; as though
working out something in her mind, she made little
circles in the dust with one foot, while she stood,
looking frowningly at the ground, and biting her
red lips. At last the difficulty—whatever it was—seemed
to have solved itself; she turned from the
road, and struck off by a side path in the direction
of the house known as The Cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>What instinct had guided her there, it would be
impossible to say; but the object of her search,
early as the hour was, was in the garden—sitting
on a rustic seat, out of the view of the windows of
the house, and with her face hidden on her hands.
Hearing the light sweep of the girl’s dress on the
grass, she rose hurriedly and disclosed the figure
of Madge Barnshaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment, the two faced each other in silence—the
one, vexed and ashamed at being discovered
in such an attitude; the other, with something
of defiance about her, mixed with a desperate
and growing anxiety. In some indefinable fashion,
each seemed to know the subject of the other’s
thoughts, and to be jealous of those thoughts, each
in a different way.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the one woman would have died sooner than
acknowledge any emotion or sorrow to the other;
the other was proud of her emotion—openly
flaunted it, as it were; and would have been glad
to think that one man’s name was branded upon
her forehead almost, that all might read her secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is anything the matter?” asked Madge, rising
to her feet, and confronting the other.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>“Dear Heaven!” cried Clara, in a sort of harsh
whisper—“can you stand there, and look at me
and ask that? Can you know that a man is as
good as dying—dying by inches, with every moment
that we live—and ask me that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t understand,” said Madge, in a low
voice. “More than all, I cannot see why you are
troubling yourself about——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clara Siggs had turned away impatiently; she
flung round now, and came at the other woman
with her hands held clenched close to her sides, and
her teeth close clenched also. “You don’t understand!
You cannot see why I should be troubling
about him! I am an inn-keeper’s daughter—only a
common girl, at the least; you are a great lady.
They say you were to marry him; will you cast
him away now, when he lies in prison, in shame
and misery—and with Death drawing nearer every
day? Is your love for him so great, that it is
something to be changed by what men say of
him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some curious shame—some strange stirring of
admiration for this wild untutored child—crept
over Madge Barnshaw. She saw, in this girl,
something stronger and more purposeful than herself—the
wild and desperate courage which might
over-ride all obstacles—which might snap fingers
at Death itself, for the sake of one man’s life. She
went nearer to the girl, and held out her hands to
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me—help me!” she whispered—“show me
what I should do!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>With that direct appeal, all poor Clara’s heroism
went to the winds; she could only cover her face
with her hands, and weep, and shake her head, and
declare how helpless she was. She could have
met defiance with defiance—pride with pride; but
the sudden tenderness of the other woman was too
much for her, and broke down at once whatever
barrier she had determined to build up between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed—I don’t know—I can’t think. I want
to help him, if I can; I want to be near him—oh—you
needn’t think,” added Clara, tearfully—“that
I am anything to him; I might have thought so
once—but I know better now. This trouble has
cleared my mind somehow, so that I can see things
as they are. If he has been—kind—and nice—to
me—it’s only as he might be to any one whose face
pleased him”—Clara tossed her head a little, despite
her tears, and seemed to suggest that she knew
the value of her own charms. “With you—well—it’s
different.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madge Barnshaw thought bitterly that it might
not be so very different, after all; thought of the
murdered girl, and bitterly blamed herself because
she could not stand aside before all the world, and
believe him innocent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Something of this must have been in the mind of
the other girl; looking at Madge steadily, she
asked, with some sternness—“You don’t believe he
did that horrible thing—do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madge Barnshaw covered her face with her
hands, and shuddered. “I don’t know—I don’t
know what to think,” she said, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>Clara turned swiftly, and began to walk away.
She had almost reached the garden gate, when
Madge, springing after her, caught her by the arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right—and I am a coward, and unworthy
of his or any one else’s love and confidence.
I will believe in him—in his innocence. You make
me believe. Tell me—what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going to Chelmsford,” replied Clara,
simply. “I want to be near him—I want to feel
that I know all that is happening. For me—it will
not matter; no one will take any notice of me. I
can go where you could not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what will you do at Chelmsford? How
will you live?” asked Madge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Clara smiled bravely, and threw up her head a
little higher. “I have a little money—no, thank
you”—as the other made a gesture, as if to reach
her purse—“I have more than I need—and I shall
take a lodging near—near the prison. I came here,
because I wanted to know—to know”—she hesitated,
and her voice trailed off, and died away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wanted to know—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To know if there was any—any message you
would wish to send to him,” replied Clara at last,
very stiffly, and with a face of scarlet. “I thought
maybe that if I could carry—carry some message
from you—you, who have the right to send one—it
might cheer him, and lead him to think better
of the world, when every one is against him. He
may not—how should he?—may not think or care
anything for what I may say—but you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madge Barnshaw moved forward quickly, and
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>took the girl in her arms. “What angel of God has
put such a thought in your heart?” she whispered.
“I shall bless you all my life for coming to me like
this—for teaching me, out of your own simple faith
and loyalty, some faith and loyalty too. Will you
promise to write to me, directly you are settled in
your new lodging? Will you promise to write
often to me—to claim from me anything you may
want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>After a little further hesitation, Clara Siggs
promised that she would communicate with her
new friend frequently. And then Madge, with her
arms still about the girl, whispered her message.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him—if you will,” she said—“that I love
him, and believe in his innocence—that I will believe
in that—and in him—until he tells me, with his own
lips, that he is guilty!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clara promised that the message should be
delivered; and, with a parting embrace the two
separated—Clara to set forth on her journey;
Madge to pace the garden wearily, and, now that
she was alone again, with a growing despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having only some five miles to traverse, before
coming into the picturesque old town of Chelmsford,
Clara Siggs first trod its streets just as the
shops were beginning to set forth their wares for
the day, and its pavements to echo with the fall of
busy feet. Rendered timid by the size of the place,
and fearful of attracting attention, she did not care
to ask her way to the jail, but wandered about,
until the frowning walls of the building looked
down upon her. Various notices were posted on a
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>door, setting forth the date of the next assizes,
together with other information—only part of
which she grasped, in her anxiety, and in the many
tumultuous thoughts which stirred her, at the remembrance
of how near she was to the place where
the man of whom she had come in search lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>She resolved, for her own comfort and satisfaction,
to get a lodging as near to the prison as
possible; and, after some little search, came to a
decent house in a by-street, in the lower window of
which a card announced that a room was to be let.
Her hesitating knock at the door was answered
promptly, by a tall, thin, angular-looking woman,
with very red hair, and a very business-like aspect.
She appeared to possess a kindly nature, however,
despite her grim appearance; and civilly invited
Clara to inspect the room advertised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I wasn’t a person as ’as bin put upon by ’er
’usband,” she ejaculated, darting a scornful glance
in the direction of a door past which they walked—“I
wouldn’t never demean myself by a takin’ a
lodger. But ’avin’ a man as give me ’is name, an’
precious little else—an’ whose delight it ’as bin to
flaunt it on the main, so to speak—an’ who now ’as
’is mind runnin’ constant on circuses, an’ fat women—(w’ich
is nothink else but a throwin’ of my figger
in my face)—I should be in a better position than I
now am, Miss. But Peter Quist won’t deceive <i>me</i>
with ’is circuses—the low Turk—an’ so I tells ’im.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had, by this time, reached the room—a
pleasant and airy place, and very simply furnished.
Clara would probably have decided to take it, whatever
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>terms might have been asked, when she saw
that its one small window looked right on to the
prison; but, as a matter of fact, the rent proved
to be very small, and the woman, being pleased
with the bright face of the girl, asked for no reference.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps from the fact that she felt most desperately
lonely and friendless, in that strange place,
Clara determined that she would tell the landlady
frankly what her mission was, and ask her advice.
Accordingly, with many tears, she told the woman
that she had come to Chelmsford, in the hope of
seeing or befriending a prisoner—a friend of hers,
then awaiting his trial. The woman proved to be
genuinely sympathetic, and, after a little cogitation,
decided to consult her husband about the matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mind you,” she said, in a voice of caution—“I’m
not sayin’ but wot Quist is a bit of a fool;
salt water do ’ave that effect on the best o’ men; it
seems to soak through, some’ow and make ’em soft.
But ’e’s got a ’eart, ’as Quist—an’ now an’ then, ’e
knows wot ’e’s about. It ain’t often—but we may
’appen to catch ’im at a lucky time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clara, willingly consenting to consult this oracle,
and inwardly praying that he might have his full
wits about him, they adjourned downstairs in search
of him. He proved to be an exceedingly amiable
looking man, with a heavy fringe of whiskers all
round a jolly red face.</p>

<p class='c009'>The circumstances having been briefly explained
by his wife, the man—no other than our old friend
Captain Peter Quist—poured himself out, from a
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>stone bottle, what he termed “a toothful”—and
proceeded to give the matter weighty consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, my lass,” he said—“w’en the Law ’as
once got a ’old on a man, an’ clapped ’im under
’atches, as it were—that man ’as got to go through
with it, right up to the end. Might I venture for to
ask wot your friend is put in irons for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed—he is quite innocent,” exclaimed Clara.
“But he has been sent to take his trial—oh—I beg
that you will not think the worse of him for that—for
murder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain whistled softly, and raised his eyebrows.
“An’ wot might be the name of this innocent
gent?” he asked, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Chater,” replied Clara, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peter Quist upset his toothful, and nearly overturned
Mrs. Quist also, in his excitement; he sprang
up, and backed away into a corner of the room.
For some moments he stood there, making curious
motions with his hands, as though warding off an
attack, and looking at Clara uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say it agin,” he said at last, in a hoarse
whisper. “Wot was the name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clara repeated it; and the Captain gradually
came out of his corner, and approached her slowly.
“Look ’ere, my lass,” he said; “I’ve ’ad a shock
over that there name—an’ I’m a bit upset with it. A
friend o’ mine sailed under that name—an’ it proved
too much for ’im—or summink did. Leastways—’e’s
dead. So I don’t want nuffink more to do with
no Chaters; I’d sooner ’elp a Smith or Jones than
a Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>Gradually, however, the Captain’s uneasiness
wore away; he began to take a lively interest in
the girl, and in her story; and went out, that very
afternoon, to ascertain if it were possible for her to
visit the prisoner, and at what hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>He returned, with the gratifying intelligence that
she might go to the prison on the next morning;
and poor Clara slept happily enough that night,
with that blessed prospect before her. The Captain,
too, was in better spirits than he had been for
some time past—a letter having reached him
through the post, which seemed to promise a
definite solution of his difficulties, in regard to
finding a circus at last. The only drawback to it
seemed to be, that there were no fat ladies attached
to it—although, perhaps, in view of Mrs. Quist, this
was not altogether a subject for sorrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was with a trembling heart that Clara presented
herself next day at the door which the Captain
pointed out to her. But everyone with whom
she came in contact seemed willing to help her—even
anxious to be of service; and she was passed
on, from one to the other, until at last she was directed
to the room where he was actually waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better wait a minute, Miss,” said a warder—“there’s
someone with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door opened at the same moment, and a
brisk-looking young gentleman came out, thrusting
some papers in his pocket as he did so. Seeing a
young girl drawn up timidly against the wall, he
stopped—hesitated a moment—and then turned towards
her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>“You’re young for such a place as this, girl,” he
said, sharply but kindly. “Are you going to see
Chater?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir.” She was scarcely able to speak for
nervousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man came nearer, and whispered
exultantly, “Splendid case—they’re proud of it
even here. And I think we shall pull him out of it—I
do, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—I am so glad to hear you say so, sir,” said
the girl, gratefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—I think he’s all right; I shall try everything.
The only difficulty is that he’s so close
about it that I can get nothing out of him. But—won’t
he make a lovely prisoner; we shan’t be able
to get into Court for the petticoats!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man walked briskly away, and Clara
passed into the room. The warder who had
brought her to the door, and who had stood aside,
while the young barrister spoke, opened the door,
and followed her in. Another warder, who had
been lounging near a high barred window, glanced
at her for a moment; and then she felt her hands
grasped by those of Philip Chater.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My child! How do you come to be here?
Are you alone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hurriedly and tearfully, she explained all that
had happened; how she had left a note at home,
telling them that she was safe, and with friends—and
would write more fully at a later time; how
she had seen Miss Barnshaw, and how she had a
message for him. And, loyal and brave as she had
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>been through everything, her heart seemed to sink
deeper and deeper, as she saw the brightness on his
face, when he heard what that message was.</p>

<p class='c009'>The warders, seeing in these two, as they
imagined, a pair of sweethearts, took but little
notice of them, beyond keeping a sharp eye upon
them. In reply to Philip’s eager questions, Clara
told him of the lodging she had taken, and mentioned
the name of her landlady—and of the Captain,
husband of that landlady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a Providence in this,” whispered Philip,
eagerly. He appeared to be deep in thought for a
moment, and then turned swiftly to the girl. “I
know this man Quist—a good and honest man, with
whom you are safe. Say nothing to him about me,
or about my knowledge of him. Now, don’t start
or cry out—come closer to me, and listen to what I
say. I shall be out of this—I <i>must</i>—within a few
hours. My defence—my life—everything depends
on that—and on myself. There is some one I must
find; to stay here means death—within a given
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Time’s up!” exclaimed one warder, shaking his
keys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An instant I beg.” He turned again to the
girl. “If you could loiter near the prison—at the
back of it, so far as I can discover,—each night—can
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no time for anything more; the girl
nodded quickly, and was hurried away. But she
went home to her lodging with a heart beating
more heavily even than before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />A CHASE IN THE DARK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Not daring to say a word in explanation to the
Captain or Mrs. Quist, Clara went out that night,
when darkness had fallen, and waited near the
prison. Fortunately, it stood in a quiet spot—not
much frequented after nightfall; she found a convenient
arched doorway, from which she could watch
the building unseen.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the first night, nothing happened; the moon
was set high in flying clouds, and the night was
very still; now and then, she heard the passing feet
of a pedestrian, crossing the end of the street in
which she stood; once, a man went along on the
opposite side, under the high walls, whistling—but
did not see her. Mrs. Quist, having provided her
with a key, in her trustfulness of heart, the girl
lingered until a very late hour, and until the last
footstep had died away. But still there was nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the second night, with a growing hope, she
waited again—wishing, with all the strength of her
love, that her eyes might pierce the heavy walls,
and discover what the prisoner was doing. She had
almost given up hoping for anything, and was preparing
to return home to her lodging, when a curious
sound broke upon her ear, and she started forward
out of the gateway, keenly watchful.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>She had heard a quick light thud upon the pavement,
and then the rapid feet of some one running.
Almost before she had had time to collect her
thoughts, or to decide whether to hide again, or
show herself, a figure dashed straight towards her,
down the street, in the shadow of the wall. Some
instinct causing her to spring out, the figure stopped,
drawn straight up against the wall, and then slowly
crossed towards her. The next moment her hands
were in those of Philip Chater.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had time, before he spoke, to notice that the
hands which held hers were cut and bleeding; that
he panted heavily, as though after some terrible exertion;
and that he was covered with dust and lime-wash,
and was hatless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Show me the way,” he panted. “Hide me somewhere—quick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hurried on with him, while he crouched in
the shadow of the houses, so that her figure might
cover him as much as possible. They had scarcely
more than a hundred yards to go, before she put her
key swiftly in the lock of a door—drew him through,
and shut it behind her. Bidding him, in a whisper,
wait where he was, in the darkness of the passage,
she softly opened the door of a lighted room, and
went in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it happened that evening, that Captain Peter
Quist was in a great state of excitement. He had
completed, that very day, the purchase of an absolutely
ideal circus; a circus in full working order,
the proprietor of which was only anxious to pass it
into the hands of its new owner, and retire into
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>private life. The delighted Captain had discovered
that his new property consisted of three or four
well-fitted caravans—a few small tents, together
with one huge one for the accommodation of his
audiences—and some waggons, with the necessary
fittings for the concern. Horses—performing and
otherwise—there were in abundance; and the Captain
had already been assured that the male and
female staff was only too ready to accept service
under him. And the proprietor, having expressed
a desire that Quist should see the show in working
order, and be initiated into its mysteries gradually,
the Captain, at the very moment of Clara’s entrance
into the room, was busily engaged in packing a few
articles which he considered proper and appropriate
to his new standing in life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief of these articles consisted of a high and
very glossy silk hat, which was at that moment
perched upon the Captain’s head; and a pair of
Wellington boots, as glossy in appearance as the
hat, and into which the Captain was struggling.
Indeed, he had just got them on, and was very red
in the face from his exertions, when Clara darted
in. Before she had had time to utter a word, Mrs.
Quist—who had been regarding her lord and master
with an expression half of admiration, half of
contempt—turned towards Clara, with a view to
relieving her feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at ’im, Miss,” she exclaimed, extending a
hand towards the Captain, who had got on to his
legs, and was swaggering about the little parlour—“did
you ever see sich a figger in all yer born days?
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>Do yer think I’d ever ’ave led <i>that</i> to the altar—if
I’d knowed wot ’e was a comin’ to in ’is old days?
Begin at the top”—she indicated the Captain’s hat—“an’
’e’s fit fer ’Igh Park, or a drorin’-room; come
to ’is middle”—the indignant woman indicated the
Captain’s seafaring blue coat—“an’ ’e’s a decent
man an’ a sailor; look at ’is legs (if so be as you’ll
excuse sich a remark, Miss)—an’ ’e might be a
coachman out o’ work, or the bottom ’arf of a
French Markiss. ’Im in a circus; w’y ’e don’t know
no more about ’osses than a bluebottle!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Old ’ard, my dear—’old ’ard,” remonstrated the
Captain, surveying his boots with a very proper
pride—“I’m merely a livin’ up to me character;
w’y, a get-up like this ’ere ’ll even make the ’osses
’ave a proper respect for me.” Then, observing suddenly
that Clara stood, with clasped hands, looking
from him to his wife appealingly, and with tears in
her eyes, he checked himself, and came slowly
towards her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, my lass,” he said, in a tone of sympathy—“wot’s
wrong with yer? You look as if you’d
’ad a fright of some kind—don’t she, Missis?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want your help,” said Clara, glancing behind
her towards the door. “My friend—the unfortunate
man of whom I spoke—Mr. Chater——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain immediately began to back away, in
some perturbation. Mrs. Quist, on the other hand,
readily divining that something was wrong, nodded
to Clara quickly to continue what she had to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Chater has—has escaped—and is here at
this moment.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>Mrs. Quist darted after Clara into the little passage;
the Captain, scarcely knowing what he did,
took off his hat, and held it pointed towards the door,
as though it were a weapon, and he might defend
himself with it. When, a moment later, Mrs. Quist
and the girl came in, and the Captain, looking past
them, saw Philip Chater enter the room, he immediately
dived down behind the table on his knees,
keeping only his eyes above the level of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take ’im away! Don’t let ’im come near me,”
he begged, in a hoarse and trembling whisper.
Then, addressing Philip in a conciliatory tone, he
added—“I never done nothink to you, ole pal, w’en
you was in the flesh—an’ all I asks is that you’ll
go back w’ere you come from—w’erever it is—an’
sleep sound. I ain’t done nothink to deserve
spooks. Go back, my lad—go back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip, despite his own danger, burst into a roar
of laughter. “There’s nothing of the ghost about
me, Quist,” he said. “I think I can understand
what you mean—and presently I’ll explain everything.
But, for the moment, I am in desperate
peril; I’ve broken out of the jail here, and may
be searched for at any moment. I want you to
hide me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain rose from his knees, still somewhat
doubtfully, and came slowly round the table; approached
Philip in gingerly fashion; and finally
ventured to take one of his hands; squeezed it—squeezed
it a little more. Then his face broke up
into smiles, and he clapped Philip jovially on the
shoulder. Remembering, however, the more serious
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>part of the business, he darted to the window, and
drew the curtain across it; then sat down, breathing
hard, and staring at Philip with all his might.
Finally, he got up, and came to Philip again, and
shook hands with him, as though to assure himself
that he was solid flesh and blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This comes of keepin’ bad company,” ejaculated
the Captain at last. “You gits yerself in the
river—an’ very bloated you looks, I do assure you—you
gits into jail—an’ you likewise gits out of it;
an’ you frightens a honest sailor-man (leastways—sailor-man
retired; circus-man now)—you frightens
him nearly out of ’is wits. But still—it’s good to
see you again; an’, if the Missis can find us a drain
o’ something’—jist a toothful apiece—we can talk
over things comfortable-like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was just at this moment, as Mrs. Quist turned
smilingly to get out bottles and glasses, that Philip
discovered, to his consternation that little Clara
Siggs, who had sat down on a sofa near him, was
swaying to and fro, with a very white face, although
she bravely tried to smile. He had just
time to step forward, and catch her in his arms,
when she gave a sort of gasp, and fainted dead
away. Overwrought for so long, she had given
way, now that the danger seemed over, and the
tension relaxed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bitterly blaming himself for having exposed her
to such trials, he picked her up tenderly in his
arms, and, guided by Mrs. Quist, carried her upstairs
to her room. There, being assured by that
good woman that it was nothing more serious than
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>a sudden attack of faintness, Philip left her in
charge of the girl, and rejoined the Captain in the
room below.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One thing I must ask you, Captain,” he said
when he was seated with that gentleman at the
table—“and that is, in regard to your taking me
for a ghost. What induced you to imagine I was
anything but the Philip Crowdy whom you knew
on the voyage from Australia?”</p>

<p class='c009'>On this, the Captain, with much detail, entered
into a full account of the finding of the body of the
unfortunate Dandy Chater by himself and Cripps;
and, although he did not know, of course, the name
of the latter, the description he gave, and his statement
that he had seen the little man on the night
of his invasion of the upper room at “The Three
Watermen,” enabled Philip to identify the man who
had been with him when the body was found. For
the first time, too, he understood the reason for the
Doctor’s consternation on meeting him in the garden
of the Cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not surprised,” said Philip, “that you
should have been upset at seeing me. The body
you took from the river was that of my brother—whom
I never knew in life. He was, I have every
reason to believe, murdered; at all events, I found
him lying dead on the river bank. I took his belongings;
I took his place—and, by Heaven, Captain—I’ve
taken his sins too. I’ve been chased and
hunted like a dog for his sins; I’ve had the best
woman in the world turn from me, as from a leper,
for his sins; and I’ve been in jail for his sins. I
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>put on this hideous disguise, at the whim of a moment;
and now I cannot shake it off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there’s them as would swear to you, if need
be,” urged the Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet,” replied Philip, hurriedly. “The time
may come when I shall be glad to declare who I
really am; for the present it is impossible. Meanwhile—what
of the body you found in the river?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—I’ve kep’a eye on the papers,” replied
the Captain—“an’ I’ve read accounts of the inquest.
They set it forth, clear and reg’lar, as ’ow
the body ’ad bin left on the river-bank, by two
parties wot was evidently afraid of ’avin’ their
names mixed up in the business; of ’ow there was
nothink on the body to show who it was—an’ the
injury to the ’ead might have bin caused by barges,
or anythink of that kind. Verdict in consequence—unknown
man—found drowned. And, I suppose,
buried accordin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—it merely leaves me in a worse position
than before. So far as all the world knows—as all
the world believes—Dandy Chater is alive—and
must stand his trial for the sins he has committed.
I have taken his place—his papers—his keys; I
should be bound to confess that I saw his body on
the shore. If they did not swear that I murdered
him, they might laugh at the story, and refuse to
recognise any mass of corruption dug up out of the
grave as the real Dandy Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then wot are you a goin’ to do?” asked the
Captain, in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is but one chance for me,” said Philip,
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>thoughtfully. “I have a suspicion that I know
who the real murderer of Dandy Chater was; if I
can once see him, and force from him any confession,
my way is clear. For that purpose I escaped
to-night—that purpose and another. And in that
I want you to help me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s my ’and on it,” said the Captain, quickly.
“But I don’t think you’ll want much ’elp, Phil,” he
added, with a laugh. “Any man as can go a breakin’
jail like you, ought to be a match for most people.
’Ow <i>did</i> yer manage it, Phil?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip laughed softly to himself. “It was rather
a tough business,” he said. “It all had to be done
in a few minutes. I was left alone in a waiting-room
for a moment, in going from one part of the
prison to another. There was a sort of skylight
high up—with hardly too much room for a cat to
wriggle through. But there were ropes to it, to
open and shut it—and you know what I can do
when there’s a rope handy, Quist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain nodded darkly and rubbed his hands;
contemplated his friend with admiration and begged
him to proceed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I nearly tore my clothes off my back, in getting
through; but, once through, there was only a roof
to slide down—a yard to cross—and a wall. Luckily
I found a builder’s pole lying against it and
scrambled up that; dropped over, and found that
dear girl in the street. She brought me here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The more they discussed the matter, the more
evident it became that Philip must be got away
before daylight. For a long time, the Captain
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>ruminated over the matter, wondering what to do.
He suggested, from time to time, the most absurd
and impracticable disguises—even offering to lend
his precious top-boots for the occasion. But at last
a really brilliant idea suggested itself to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The circus!” he exclaimed, slapping his leg
with much vehemence. “That’s the very thing!
I’m a goin’ out to see them move the show, quite
early to-morrow morning’—just to see ’ow it’s done.
They’ve got to start precious early, so as to reach
the town they’re a goin’ to in time for the performance
at night. Now—wishin’ to identify myself
with the business as early as possible—I’ve asked
’em to send in one of the caravans to fetch me—so
as to make a sort of percession of it. As the show’s
mine, of course they don’t mind a gratifyin’ a little
weakness like that. Now—if you can’t ’ide in a
caravan—w’ere can you ’ide, Phil?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds like the very thing,” replied Philip.
“You can drop me quietly on the road, when we
are clear of the town, and nothing need be known
of me. But what of this girl, who has been so
brave and loyal to me? I can’t leave her behind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s easy arranged,” responded the Captain.
“Let ’er stop ’ere; the Missis ’ll be glad to give ’er
shelter as long as you like; an’ you may be sure
she’s in good ’ands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip gratefully accepted the offer; and, neither
of them being disposed for sleep, they sat and
talked the night away, or such part of it as remained.
Philip duly impressed upon the Captain
the necessity for preserving silence concerning the
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>real story of Dandy Chater—making his plea more
forcible by telling the worthy man of the difficulties
he might find himself in, should it become known
that he had harboured a fugitive, or assisted him to
escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after four o’clock in the morning, wheels
were heard outside, in the quiet street, and a knock
sounded at the door. The Captain—spying out the
land from the window—signalled to Philip that all
was right, and they prepared to set out. Mrs. Quist
had come downstairs, and had announced that the
girl was sleeping soundly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I won’t disturb her,” said Philip. “I
know that she will be well cared for, and I am
more grateful than I can express. Will you tell
her, when she wakes, that I am safe, and have gone
with the Captain; that I will find an opportunity
of seeing her mother, and assuring her that her
child is safe? And now, if the Captain can lend
me a cap of some sort, I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain would have pressed his own gorgeous
silk hat upon his friend, but being dissuaded
from this with some difficulty, provided him with
a cloth cap, which would be less likely to attract
attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the Captain sallied out, to be sure that the
coast was clear; and, there being no one in sight,
Philip took leave of Mrs. Quist, and darted into the
caravan, which moved off at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was still quite dark when they got clear at
last of the streets of Chelmsford; and Philip Chater
was beginning to congratulate himself upon the
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>fact of having got out of his difficulties so neatly,
when the man who acted as driver, and to whom
the Captain must have given some word of warning,
rapped smartly on the side of the vehicle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain, who had begun to fill his pipe, and
had quite settled down to the enjoyment of his
ride, popped open the little window in the side
of the caravan, and put out his head. “What’s
wrong, mess-mate?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man informed him rapidly that there was a
gig—so far as he could make out, judging by the
twin lights—coming over the hill behind them from
the town—and evidently coming at a great rate.
Indeed, in the silence—the caravan having stopped—they
could hear the swift beat of a horse’s hoofs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ask him what road we are on,” said Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain did so, and the man replied promptly
that they were heading towards Bamberton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just where I want to go,” whispered Philip to
the Captain. “Now—I don’t want to get you into
trouble, old friend—as you would most assuredly,
if I were found in your company. Therefore, you
can drop me here by the roadside, and go on without
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m damned if I do!” said the Captain,
sturdily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must,” replied Philip. “If I remain
here, I shall certainly be taken, quite apart from
getting you into difficulties. On the other hand, if
I drop out in the darkness, I can lie close under a
hedge until they’ve gone by. And you, for your
own satisfaction, can give them a false direction.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>This last point appeared to settle the matter
with the Captain; Philip left him chuckling hugely
to himself. Just as the caravan was beginning to
move on again and while Philip lay crouched behind
a hedge, the gig dashed up, and drew rein
within hearing of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot!” exclaimed the Captain, in a voice of apparent
indignation, the moment he heard that a
prisoner was missing, and was believed to have
taken the road to Bamberton—“You don’t mean a
tall clean-shaven dark chap, without a ’at?” On
being assured that that was a correct description of
the fugitive, the Captain became more indignant
than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you goes along that ’ere road to the left,
about a ’underd yards further back—you’ll nab ’im—sure
as eggs,” he exclaimed. “’E was runnin’
like a good ’un—tol’ me ’e was a doin’ it for a
wager. W’en you ketches ’im, guv’nor—’it ’im one
fer me—will yer—for a tryin’ ter deceive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to have a look inside your
caravan,” said the man, quietly, jumping down
from the gig.</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’y—certainly,” responded the Captain. “It’s
a nice roomy place, pervided yer don’t git yer feet
in the fireplace. I’d ’ave ’ad it painted special, if
I’d knowed you was comin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man looked in at the open door of the
vehicle; looked sharply at the Captain, and at the
driver; and climbed into the gig again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drive on,” he said; and the gig turned back on
the road it had come.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>“Drive on, mess-mate,” said the Captain, climbing
into the caravan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater, lying behind the hedge, watched
the two vehicles until they were out of sight in the
darkness; then, when there seemed nothing more
to be feared, he crept out, and struck off towards
Bamberton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was the message?” he muttered to himself.
“‘I love him—and believe in his innocence.’
Dear girl! I’ll see you to-night—if I die for it!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />HAUNTED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>That one thought dominated all else in the mind
of Philip Chater. She believed him innocent—and
she loved him. True, the message was not for him,
in reality; it was for the man who lay in an unknown
grave. But, having taken that dead man’s
place, he claimed this message also, as belonging
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have taken the burden of his sins upon me—I
am in peril of my life on account of them,” he
thought. “Surely I have the right to claim this
sweeter portion of what was his, as some leaven in
the weight of my punishment. Yes—I’ll see her
first; after that, if they capture me, I’ll go back
with a light heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caution was necessary in approaching the village;
for, by the time he reached it, daylight had fully
come, and the people were astir. Keeping well on
the outskirts of it, and yet in a place from which he
could easily and rapidly reach the spot he had
marked out in his mind as his destination, he came
to a little copse, on the edge of some fields, and
settled himself, as comfortably as possible, in a deep
dry ditch, overhung with brambles and bushes,
which completely hid him from the sight of any
one passing near. Knowing that he must wait until
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>nightfall, before daring to venture out, he resolved
to remain in this place, with all the patience
he could muster.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had borrowed from Captain Quist a little
tobacco and a pipe; and, after cautiously looking
about him, he filled and lit this, and began to feel
more resigned to his position. From where he lay,
he could see, through the tangled growth above
him, the towers and chimneys of Chater Hall; raising
his head a little he could see a path, which
wound across some slightly rising ground, and appeared
to lead from the Hall down to the road near
which he lay—entry to the road from it being obtained
through a wooden gate in the high paling,
which surrounded the grounds at the point where
they joined the road. The Hall being high above
him, he could see this path in its windings and
twistings very clearly; and, as it was a short cut
to the village, it appeared to be used pretty often.</p>

<p class='c009'>It amused and interested the fugitive, lying
hidden there, to watch this path, and those who
came down it; he found himself wondering idly
whether he should ever tread that path again or
set foot in Chater Hall, and under what circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Knowing nothing of the locality, Philip had not
chosen his hiding place so well as he had hoped;
for presently he was startled by the noise of wheels
behind him. Rising hurriedly, he looked over a
bank, sheer down into a road below—a road not so
broad as that which lay at some distance in front
of him, but broad enough for vehicles. Indeed, the
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>vehicle which Philip had heard had stopped immediately
below him, and a man in it was alighting.
So close was it, and so immediately underneath
where he lay in the thick undergrowth, that Philip
could hear distinctly what this man said to the
driver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I brought you this way—because I have a fancy
for going up to the Hall unannounced—just a mere
whim of mine. I can get over from here. It’ll be—ha—ha—a
little surprise for them—won’t it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man muttered something, which Philip could
not catch; received his fare; turned his horse’s
head, and drove back the way he had come. The
man stood quite still in the road, until the vehicle
was out of sight; then began to climb the bank,
which led to the place where Philip was concealed.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first, Philip was afraid that the man had seen
him, and was coming straight for him; he dived
down, and lay flat, scarcely daring to breathe. But
the stranger, who evidently knew the place well,
came on steadily, until he stood within a few yards
of the spot where Philip crouched; then he stopped,
and looked straight across at the distant chimneys
of Chater Hall. As he stood there, Philip found
himself watching the man with an eagerness greater
than he would have felt at the appearance of any
chance stranger; for he knew the face of this man.
Once again, he seemed to stand at the entrance to
a little court, leading down to the river, at Woolwich;
once again, to see a man dash past him, and
to catch a glimpse of a face—gone in an instant,
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>and seemingly forgotten—but well enough remembered
now. Again, too, he seemed to stand on the
terrace at Chater Hall, on that night of the burglary,
striving to peer in through a window; to see the
curtain suddenly flung back, and the room bright
with lights, and that same face staring out at him.
Small wonder that his heart beat heavily, as he lay
crouched among the bushes, looking up at the man
above him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger, for his part, seemed to hesitate
what to do; made a step forward more than once,
as if to go boldly across the road, and up the path
to the house before him; and as often stopped, and
turned about, and waited where he was.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater was beginning to wonder what was
to happen, and was half resolved—in the wild hurry
of the thoughts which came crowding upon him—to
spring out, and confront the man, when another
figure seemed to spring almost from the grass near
at hand, and to make rapidly towards the first
comer. Philip, raising his head quickly, no sooner
caught sight of this second man, than he dropped
down flat again, at the bottom of the ditch.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Inspector Tokely; and that gentleman
came forward with a threatening aspect, and
stopped within about a yard of the other, who was
much taller than himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Ogledon, I believe,” said the Inspector,
grimly; and Philip almost jumped out of his place
again, at the mention of that name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—what of it?” was the surly reply; and
it almost seemed to the listening man as though the
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>speaker looked Tokely up and down superciliously
as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What of it, sir!” cried the other, fiercely.
“This of it, Mr. Ogledon—that you have insulted
and maltreated the Law, as personified in me—in
<i>me</i>, sir! That I have been lured into your presence,
and, while in the execution of my duty, have been
struck on a tender spot—to wit, the head—by a
debauched companion of yours, and with a hard and
heavy substance—to wit, a decanter; such assault
being committed in order to delay, frustrate, postpone,
or prevent the arrest of a certain person
against whom I held a warrant. Damme, sir—what
have you to say to that?” exclaimed the little
man, suddenly losing his legal technicalities in an
outburst of fury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dare say you think you have cause of complaint
against me”—began the other, coolly; but Tokely
burst in again, more furiously than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cause of complaint!” he almost shrieked.
“When a man—and that man an officer of the
Law—has a bump raised on his head, which compels
him to wear his hat like a giddy youth on a
bank-holiday excursion, and which prevents his
lying with comfort in his bed—and the abettor of
the outrage talks about cause of complaint!—I
wonder, sir, what you will think when you occupy
a cell, on account of this—eh, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am extremely sorry,” replied Ogledon—“very
sorry indeed that you should have been caused any
inconvenience. My friend is not—not responsible
for his actions at times—and he—he mistook you for
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>some one else.” All this time, Ogledon was working
round the Inspector, and watching him narrowly.
The Inspector, for his part, respecting the
size and apparent strength of the other, began to
move away; but flung back a taunt or two as he
went.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall hear from me again, sir!” cried the
little man, savagely. “You and your decanter!
You may like to know that I got my prisoner,
after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the devil with your prisoner!” cried Ogledon
without looking round. The little man stopped,
although at a safe distance, and even came back a
pace or two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oho!” he cried, with a vicious laugh—“I
thought he was a friend of yours? I suppose you
don’t own him now—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly own no interest in any prisoners,”
said the other, glancing round at Tokely for a moment,
and then turning away again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed!” exclaimed the Inspector, more loudly
even than before. “Yet you don’t mind living in
his house, and knocking people about with his decanters!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What on earth are you talking about?” asked
Ogledon, with a new and sudden interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Inspector came a little nearer. “About
your friend—Mr. Dandy Chater!” With this last
shot, he turned and began to walk away down the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip, looking out cautiously, saw the man who
had been addressed as Ogledon start, as if a blow
had been struck him; hesitate for a moment, with
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>a face that was ghastly; and then start off at a
run after Tokely. The Inspector, who was totally
unprepared for pursuit, was overtaken in a few
strides; seized; swung round; and confronted with
the startled face of the other man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop—stop—and listen to me!” cried Ogledon,
wildly. “What of this—this man—this prisoner—this”—he
appeared to have some difficulty in getting
out the name from his throat—as though it
stuck there a little—“this Dandy Chater?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—that stirs you up a bit—does it?” said
Tokely, grinning. “Let me tell you then, that
your friend Mr. Dandy Chater lies at this moment
in Chelmsford Jail, awaiting his trial for murder—ah—that
makes your face turn white—eh?—murder
committed in this very village.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon had dropped his hands from the other’s
shoulders, and was staring at him, with an expression
of stupid wonderment, incredulity and deadly
fear. After a moment or two, he said, in a sort of
whisper—“Then I did read of it; I haven’t merely
seen the name in every paper I’ve picked up—just
in the same fashion as I have seen it on the lips of
every man I met; heard it in every wind that
blew; seen it spelled in the stars on every night-sky.”
He broke off suddenly, and looked at the
other man, as if only just aware at that moment of
his presence; looked at him silently for a space;
and then burst into a peal of the most frightful
laughter imaginable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s nothing like being merry, when you’ve
got a chance,” said the Inspector, savagely.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>“Merry!” cried the other, with another shout of
laughter. “You’d make the dead rise from their
graves, to laugh at such a jest as this! Merry!
And so you’ve got Dandy Chater safe in Chelmsford
Jail—have you? Well—keep him safe; lock
and bolt and bar him in—and stop up every chink
and keyhole—or, by Heaven!—Dandy Chater may
give you the slip, my man! Dandy Chater in
Chelmsford Jail!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He burst into another frightful roar of laughter,
and turned away; while the Inspector, after looking
at him oddly, for a few moments, continued his
way down the hill towards the road. Ogledon
stopped in the same spot as before, near where
Philip still lay, and sat down on the bank, above
the very ditch in which the fugitive crouched, but
with his back towards him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My God—what does this mean?” He spoke
aloud, quite unconsciously, in the strong emotion
which was upon him. “Is this some devil’s trick,
to frighten and trouble me? Or has Something
come back to earth, to take up again its old way of
life, and mock me?” He stretched out one
clenched hand, and looked at it. “With this hand
I struck him down; my eyes saw him lying dead;
other eyes have seen him—food for worms—taken
from the river. Yet this Thing starts up again, full
of life, the very next day; haunts the places where
he was known; appears even to me; stands out as
a living fact to all men, and is even printed about,
in black and white, before my eyes. Am I going
mad; is this some distortion of the brain? Do I
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>dream that every one talks of him, even in a chance
meeting like this a few minutes since—or what is
it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>After a time, he got up, and spoke more resolutely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve allowed myself to think of him too much;
I’ll do so no longer. I’ve heard of men who,
dwelling on one frightful vision always, grow at
last to see it in everything about them—hear it in
every word that’s uttered—until it fills every fibre
of their being, like some horrible disease, and saps
their reason and their life. I’ll have no more of it;
the man is dead, and I stand in his place; let that
end it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned about resolutely, and went down by
the road the Inspector had taken. After a little
time, Philip, from his place of concealment, saw
him mounting the path opposite, on the way to
Chater Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the weary hours, Philip waited, crouched
where he was, cramped and stiff, until night came
on, and the moon rose, in ghostly fashion, over the
hill before him. Then, very cautiously, and looking
all about him in case of surprise, he started for the
Cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a recklessness upon him, greater than
any he had felt yet. What happened after this
night he scarcely seemed to care; to see that one
woman once again, and hold her in his arms, and
hear from her own lips the message she had sent
him, seemed enough. Whatever Fate might have in
store for him after that did not seem to matter;
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>this one night, at least, he was free, and he was going
to the woman he loved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still, with all his recklessness, he was careful not
to expose himself to any danger of capture; in a
little time, he became quite an adept at dodging behind
hedges, or dropping down flat among thick
undergrowth, when any one came near him. But
he reached the boundary hedge of the garden he
remembered so well at last, and crouched behind it,
striving to peer through—wondering how he should
reach her, or make his presence known.</p>

<p class='c009'>Voices in the garden, quite near to him, struck
upon his ear; voices of a man and a woman—that
of the man soft, smooth, and pleading—that of the
woman angry, contemptuous, and scornful. And
he knew both voices at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two who talked in that garden in the moonlight
appeared to be further up the lawn than the
spot where he was; looking eagerly in that direction,
he saw that the regularity of the trim hedge
was broken by a thick growth of small trees, whose
branches swept down to the ground. Gliding along
noiselessly, he got amongst these, and lay flat,
within a few feet of the pair upon the lawn; could
see them distinctly, standing there facing each
other—Ogledon and Madge Barnshaw. That they
had arrived at a crisis of some kind in their talk
was evident; for Madge stood proudly erect and
defiant, looking at the man, who slashed savagely
at the grass with a cane he held.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will nothing move you?” Ogledon was saying,
without looking up at her. “Do you think it
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>is nothing for me, who am no mere boy, to be the
sport of a girl—do you think it’s nothing for me to
have to plead, again and again, with you, when it
is my nature to bend people to my will, and gain
what I desire by force?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have told you—many, many times already—that
you might as well fling yourself against a
rock, as strive to move me by any pleading. You
are a coward, in any case, to assail me like this,
when I have already told you that my heart is given
to some one else——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bah!—a mere girlish whim—a boy-and-girl affair,
that should have been forgotten and done
with in the days of pinafores. Besides, Dandy
Chater is”—he hesitated, and seemed for a moment
uncertain what to say; turned the sentence swiftly,
and asked instead, with his keen eyes raised to her
face—“By the way—where is this wonderful lover
of yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a pause for a moment, while the
listener almost held his breath, and while Ogledon
never took his eyes from her face. Then she went
a little nearer to him, and held her head more
proudly still.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a prison—there to await his trial on a fearful
charge—of which I believe him innocent. But,
though he appeared twice as black as men paint
him, and as you, his evil spirit, have tried to make
him, I would hold to him to the last; would cry,
before you and all others—‘I love him—I love him—I
love him!’ Now, what think you your pleading
will do for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>The man had turned, and walked a step or two
away; his hand had gone up nervously to his lips.
“What does it mean?” Philip heard him mutter.
“They all say it—even she says it. Go where I
will, this Thing follows me—this name is dinned
into my ears.” He turned swiftly towards her.
“Why do you lie to me?” he cried harshly; “why
do you repeat what every one else repeats? Do
you think to frighten me away by such——” He
stopped confusedly, and laughed. “There—I don’t
know what I am saying; I—I lose myself sometimes.
I—I’m not well; I’ll come—some other
time—to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without another word he turned quickly and
hurried out of the garden leaving the girl standing
alone in the moonlight. Philip waited until he
heard the gate click, and the footsteps of the man
dying away in the distance; then he came out of
his hiding-place, and spoke her name in a whisper.
She turned about swiftly, and would have cried
out, but that he caught her in his arms, and laid a
hand lightly on her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, dearest,” he whispered—“I have escaped
from prison, to come to you; just to look into your
dear eyes—to touch your lips—to know that all is
well with you, and that you are not changed towards
me. Don’t speak for a moment; there is
much that I must say to you. There is small
chance of my final escape; I must I fear inevitably
be caught, and taken back again to stand my
trial.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you are innocent, Dandy dear,” she whispered,
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>hurriedly; “and you can prove your innocence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As God above is my witness, I am absolutely
innocent,” he replied. “But I cannot—I dare not
prove it; some day you will understand the reason.
If I was never firm upon this matter before, I am
firm from to-night. But, if it should go hard with
me, and there should be no way of escape, I want
you to promise one thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything—everything,” she whispered, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it should come to that, and there is no other
way—find the man who was here with you just
now—and ask him to tell you all he knows about
Dandy Chater. He—and he alone—can establish
my innocence. But this must only be done as a
last resource. Will you promise that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had begun to question him wildly and eagerly,
when he suddenly raised his hand to silence her;
they both stood listening. The garden gate had
clicked again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip dropped down among the shadows of the
trees, and crept in amongst them again. Across the
turf came a figure, noiselessly, and stopped before
Madge, who had walked a few paces away from
where Philip lay. The figure was that of Ogledon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had no intention of troubling you again—at
least, to-night”—he said, in a curiously strained
voice, as though he were keeping control of it with
difficulty—“but there is something I should like to
ask you. I have been away—on the Continent—and
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>have only returned a few hours ago. This
lover of yours and cousin of mine—this Dandy
Chater——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Chelmsford Jail,” she reminded him, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Chelmsford Jail. When—when did you see
him last?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was on the point of answering, in some
equivocal fashion which should not betray the fugitive,
when she stopped, struck dumb by the expression
on Ogledon’s face. He was looking past her,
at something behind; turning, she saw Philip standing
bareheaded and perfectly still in the moonlight,
against the background of dark trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogledon stood for a moment, with his eyes starting,
and his breath coming and going in gasps,
while Philip stood absolutely rigid; then, with a
terrible cry, he dropped forward upon his knees, and
covered his face with his hands. When he ventured
to look up again, Philip had vanished into the
shadows.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />NEPTUNE TO THE RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Not daring to venture near the Cottage again,
Philip got as near to the village as he could, and
hung about, until lights were gleaming only in the
upper windows of cottages, and until the doors of
the Chater Arms had been closed for some time upon
the last roystering yokel who had had more than was
good for him. His purpose was to see Betty Siggs,
and assure her, in accordance with his promise, of
Clara’s welfare. But it took a longer time to carry
out his purpose than he had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over and over again, when he was almost within
touch of the place, he would fancy he heard a door
being opened, or that footsteps were coming cautiously
towards him; and would make a dash back
into the darkness. At last, however, he managed
to get round to the back of the inn, and to take a
survey of its windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, it so happened that two of those windows
were lighted—clearly showing that some one else
was going to bed, in addition to Toby Siggs and his
wife. Knowing nothing about the disposition of
the various rooms upstairs, Philip was, for a time,
at a loss what to do; being dreadfully afraid that
he might rouse the wrong party and bring disaster
upon himself. At last, tired with waiting, he determined
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>to take the risk, and to throw a few small
pebbles at the larger of the two lighted windows.
This he did—sending the stones rattling smartly
against the glass once or twice—and then crept into
the darkness, and awaited results.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unfortunately, it happened that the chief guest
room at the Chater Arms was the largest room upstairs;
and that Mr. and Mrs. Siggs, in their modesty,
and with an eye to business, occupied a smaller
apartment. And in that guest room, at that particular
time, reposed the important figure of Inspector
Tokely, who had been stopped, in his projected
return to London that afternoon, by the intelligence
that his prisoner had broken jail, and was thought
to be in the neighbourhood of Bamberton.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first, the rattle of the stones had no effect
upon the sleeping officer of the Law; but Philip’s
second attempt roused him from sleep, and drove
him to the unwelcome thought that some one was
playing practical jokes upon him, as a form of rustic
humour. Not at all relishing this, he sprang
out of bed, just as a third handful pattered against
the panes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The indignant Tokely dashed to the window, and
drew up the blind; then, unable to see anything, he
flung up the window-sash, and poked out his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s down there?” he cried out. “You’d
better come out—because I know who you are, and
I’ll lay you by the heels to-morrow morning, as sure
as a gun. Now then—are you coming out of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip, who had drawn himself up in the darkest
corner of the yard, horror-struck at his blunder, very
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>naturally declining to obey the Inspector’s bidding,
that indignant man continued to shout various
threats of future punishment into the darkness, until
he contrived to rouse his host and hostess; so that,
in a minute or two, the second lighted window was
raised, and old Toby Siggs put his head out, with a
most prodigious nightcap upon it, and looked round
at Tokely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot’s all this?” he asked, in his slow heavy
fashion. “If so be as you ’ave a pain anywheres,
the Missis ’ll be on’y too glad to git up, an’ make a
poultice, or anythink of that kind, double quick;
on’y don’t go a ’owlin’ at the moon like that there—jist
like a lost dorg—’cos it ain’t restful at this
time o’ night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not howling at the moon—or at anything
else,” retorted Tokely, savagely. “And I’m not in
pain, you idiot. Only some yokel has had the impudence
to keep on shying pebbles at my window,
this half hour past—by way of a joke, I suppose. I
wish they’d try any one else’s window, for a
change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wot did you ’ave for supper?” was the extraordinary
query propounded by Toby, after a
thoughtful pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the deuce has that got to do with it?”
snapped out the Inspector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—nothink,” replied Toby, innocently. “On’y
I thought you might p’raps ’ave bin dreaming’—that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tokely muttered something decidedly uncomplimentary
under his breath, and jerked down the
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>blind—quite forgetting, in his rage, about the window.
Moreover, being thoroughly roused from any
sleep, or thoughts of it, he sat down near his bedstead,
to think about the matter, and to decide how
best he could visit his wrath upon some one for the
offence on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sitting thus, engaged with his own angry
thoughts, he lost count of time, until presently he
was startled by another sound of the striking of
pebbles against glass. But the curious thing was,
that it was not his window which received the attack
this time, but another—for the sound was far
less distinct. The Inspector quietly blew out his
candle, and crept to the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few moments, there was another little
shower of pebbles; and the Inspector, quietly drawing
aside the blind, peered down into the darkness.
Then he heard the creak of a window being softly
raised, and a bright light, as from a candle, fell on
the ground below, and on a figure standing there.
And this figure, raising its head, and looking up,
revealed to the watching Tokely the face of Dandy
Chater, who should have been, by all right and propriety,
at that moment in Chelmsford Jail.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little mother!” came in a quick whisper from
below; and a voice—that of Mrs. Siggs—responded
promptly in the same cautious fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my dear, dear boy. Wait just one blessed
minute, and I’ll come down to you,” cried Betty,
softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait just one blessed minute, and <i>I</i>’ll come
down to you,” muttered the Inspector to himself.
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>“This is a piece of luck, indeed!” The Inspector
crept away from the window, and began, hurriedly
and noiselessly, to get into his garments.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few moments, he heard, as he had fully anticipated,
a rustling upon the staircase, and a quick
footstep going downwards; immediately after, the
cautious drawing back of bolts, and the turning of
a key; then, the subdued sound of voices. The Inspector
dressed with greater rapidity than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, Mrs. Siggs had drawn Philip into the
little parlour, and had laid her old head—nightcap
and all—upon his shoulder, and was crying comfortably.
It was some time before she could compose
herself sufficiently to listen to what he had to
say; but she did at last, only punctuating what he
said by an occasional sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First—for my time is very short—about Clara,”
he said. “I blame myself horribly for all the
anxiety she has caused you; but you know, little
mother, that she fell in love with that scapegrace
brother of mine, and only transferred her affections
to me, without knowing it. But the child’s safe—I
give you my word for it; and I think you can trust
me, Betty, to deliver her into your hands again,
when the time comes for speaking the truth. But
that time is not yet; for the present, you must be
silent; everything I value most on earth depends
on that. I am getting nearer, every hour, little
mother, to the end of my difficulties; I am on the
track of the man who murdered my brother, and
can declare my innocence. If I can remain free
but a few hours longer, I may be able to devise
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>some plan—some way out of the tangle. Don’t
you see my strange position; that, for my own
sake, as well as yours, I want to declare to the
world that I am Philip Chater, and innocent of all
these sins which have been visited upon me; while,
for the sake of one dear woman, I want to remain
Dandy Chater, because—God help me!—she loves
Dandy Chater—and I am a stranger to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—yer don’t stand much chance of goin’
free if yer chucks stones up at that there Tokely’s
winder,” said Betty, laughing through her tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had no idea that the man was still here,” replied
Philip, “and, of course, I couldn’t be expected
to know which window was yours; I had to take
the risk of that. But I saw his light go out;
there’s no doubt that he is sleeping peacefully, and
dreaming of anything but Dandy Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when
the door leading from the staircase was opened abruptly,
and Toby Siggs thrust in his head, and
looked at them with a scared face. On the principle
that whatever Betty did was sure to be right,
Toby would not have thought of questioning her,
concerning her championship of the supposed Dandy
Chater, or of her endeavours to hide him. Obedient
to Philip’s injunction, Mrs. Siggs had refrained from
entering into any explanation with Toby—who was,
if the truth be told, somewhat of a gossip. But, at
the present moment, loyalty to his wife, no less than
to the man whose cause she upheld, had prompted
him to leave his chamber, and creep down to give
them warning.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>“Betty, old gal—that there Tokely—as is the
deepest ever I see—an’ the most careful of ’is precious
skin—’as gorn off to fetch assistance.” It
took Toby a long time to say this, in his slow and
ponderous fashion; but he got it out at last, and
stood nodding his head prodigiously when he had
finished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked Philip quickly,
making a movement towards the door. “I’ve
heard no one about the house; how could he have
got out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Artfulness—downright perlice artfulness—an’
nothink else,” replied Toby, slowly. “Arter you
chucked stones at ’is winder, an’ arter I’d ’ad that
little argyment with ’im, I thought ’e’d gone to by-bye;
but not ’e. I ’eard a scrapin’ agin’ the wall,
an’ looked out; an’ there was that Tokely, shinnin’
down a sort of rope, made of the Missis’ best company
sheets. ’E’s gone straight down to the village
constable, to get ’im an’ a few more—so as to
make sure of yer, Master Dandy. An’, by the noise—’ere
they come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater, even while Toby’s slow speech
was in progress, had become aware of a noise of
feet and a murmur of voices outside. “It’s all
over, Betty, I’m afraid,” he said, in a low voice—“but
I think I’ll try a dash for it. Good-bye, little
mother; don’t fear for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Feeling more valiant than usual, with a good
backing of yokels, and the village constable, Inspector
Tokely came straight into the room, and
walked up to Philip, smiling grimly. Before, however,
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>he had had an opportunity for saying a word,
Philip stepped forward, and caught him by the
arms; swung him round, by the impulse of that
movement, straight to Toby Siggs, and dashed
headlong at the crowd in the doorway. Toby, for
his part, receiving the full weight of the Inspector
on his stockinged feet, immediately held fast to
that gentleman, and began to pummel him soundly
on his own account—heedless of the fact that
Philip had only been able to fight his way into the
midst of a considerable crowd of men, and had
there been secured. The Inspector, writhing under
his punishment, and struggling vainly to get away,
was shouting out orders, entreaties, and threats, in
the most confusing fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, some sort of order being restored, and
the Inspector released, the two principals in the
little scene faced each other in Betty Siggs’s parlour,
with a crowd of eager faces about them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” gasped Tokely—“so I’ve got you, have
I, Mr. Dandy Chater!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray be accurate, policeman,” replied Philip,
coolly. “<i>You</i> haven’t got me; it’s these good
fellows you have to thank for that. I congratulate
you on your bravery, policeman; you have brought
a pretty good mob against me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a smothered laugh at the expense of
the Inspector, who turned rather red. “I knew
you to be a dangerous character,” he said—“and I
did not intend that you should slip through my
fingers again. For the present, Mr. Siggs”—he
turned towards Toby, with a malicious grin on his
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>face—“I must trouble you to give over this room—in
the Queen’s name—until such time as I can
get a trap, to drive this man back to Chelmsford;
one or two of us will wait here with him, until it
arrives. He may be a desperate character, but he
won’t get over me in a hurry. Here—catch his
arms, some of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost before Philip realised what had happened,
his arms were pinioned, and he felt something
hard and cold forced over his wrists. When
the men fell away from him, he discovered that he
was securely handcuffed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re surely not going to drive me through
the open country, with these things on my hands—are
you?” he asked bitterly. “If I give you my
word not to attempt to escape——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We won’t trust your word, Dandy Chater,”
said Tokely, grinning again. “You’ve given us a
pretty good chase, as it is—and any amount of
trouble; and there are one or two people”—he
glanced for a moment at Toby, and then at Betty
Siggs—“against whom I intend to apply for warrants—for
aiding and abetting you to escape, and
for obstructing me in the execution of my duty.
I’ve been hit over the head with decanters—and
have barked myself painfully again trees—and
have been struck heavily in the region of the ribs
by——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you should ’appen to refer to me, with that
there last remark”—said Toby, slowly—“let me
recommend that you don’t go a jumping’—promiscuous-like—on
a man’s corns, without so much as ‘by
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>yer leave.’ I don’t permit no man—much less a
perliceman—to jump on me in my own parlour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without deigning any reply to this, the Inspector
told off two or three of the men to remain with
him, and dismissed the others outside the door,
which he shut. The crowd by the sounds which
proceeded from the yard, was evidently in no mood
to go home to bed; but remained, discussing the
matter excitedly, and no doubt taking much individual
credit to itself, for the successful issue of
the business.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long and weary half hour, Philip sat, with
his eyes upon the ground, waiting until such time
as the man who had been sent for a conveyance
should return; and, during that time, a curious
thing happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>There sat next to him, a tall, thin individual, with
a melancholy visage—a man who had not, curiously
enough, taken any part in the actual fray, but who,
nevertheless, had thrust himself forward eagerly,
when the men who were to guard the prisoner were
selected. Once or twice, Philip was under the
curious impression that the man was striving to attract
his attention; he lunged out one of his thin
legs at him sideways, once or twice, while the Inspector
happened to be engaged in conversation
with the constable and the other men. At last, he
found an excuse to get up from his chair, and pass
in front of Philip; tripped—purposely, as it seemed
over the prisoner’s feet; and turned swiftly to
make an apology.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beggin’ yer pardon, sir, I’m sure—’adn’t no intention
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>of”—the words died away, in a sort of
growl; but at the end of them, as the man bent
his head to speak, Philip heard distinctly the whisper—“Cap’n
Quist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip was so astounded, and his heart began to
beat so fast, at the probable thought that a friend
was near at hand, that he could scarcely control
himself. But he managed to keep his eyes fixed,
apparently on the floor, even while he turned
towards the man, who had resumed his seat. His
astonishment was greater than ever, when he saw
that man, on the pretext of scratching his arm, pull
up his sleeve a little way, and disclose—so that
Philip alone saw them—certain heavy tattoo marks,
such as would scarcely be likely to be on the skin
of any one but a sailor.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment, wheels were heard at the front
of the house, and, the door being unfastened by
Toby—who had gone with Betty into the bar—a
man came in, and walked straight through to where
Tokely was standing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t get a trap, sir, anywheres; but I managed
to get a fly—and it’s at the door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right—a fly will do better than anything;
we’ll have him safer there than elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man with the melancholy visage suddenly
emitted a most extraordinary sound—a sound
which, had it moved any part of his face in any
way, might have been described as a laugh; but,
as his countenance appeared as melancholy after
it as before, it did not seem possible that it arose
from mirth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>“What’s the matter?” asked Tokely, turning
towards the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nuffink, guv’nor. It’s rather a nasty corf, that
ketches me now and agin,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip was thrust into the vehicle, together with
the man of the melancholy countenance—who stuck
close to him, and even held his arm, as though
afraid of losing him—and Tokely. When one of
the watchers suggested that he might want other
assistance, in view of the prisoner proving refractory,
Tokely admitted that it might be better for
one of them to get on the box with the driver;
but, immediately afterwards, thinking apparently
that such extra precaution might be put down to
cowardice on his part, he countermanded the order;
so that the prisoner drove off with only the melancholy-looking
man and Tokely inside, and the driver
on the box.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip’s mind was chiefly occupied with wonder
as to what was going to happen. That the melancholy
man was an emissary of Captain Quist, he did
not doubt; at the same time, lest he should alarm
the Inspector, and so frustrate any plan which might
have been formed for his own rescue, he sat still in
a corner of the fly, apparently in a sulky humour,
but really alert and watchful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment came at last. A shrill whistle
sounded somewhere out of the blackness of the
night. It was answered, in an instant, with deafening
intensity, by the melancholy man, who on
the instant leapt upon Tokely, and seemed to be
doing something extraordinary, in the midst of a
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>violent struggle, with that gentleman’s arms. In
less time than it takes to tell, a figure appeared,
through the glass of one window, racing along beside
the vehicle; the door was wrenched open, and
Philip was tumbled out, with the melancholy man
literally on top of him, into the road; the door was
slammed, and the horse, maddened by a cut across
his haunches from a long whip, fairly took the bit
in his teeth, and dashed straight down the road like
a racer. The last that Philip saw of the vehicle,
as he sat up in the road and looked after it, was it
swaying from side to side of the road, while the
unfortunate Tokely (whose arms had been pinioned
behind him with true sailor-like adroitness) had his
head thrust out of one window, and was vainly
shouting to the driver.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, a familiar voice broke upon Philip’s ear,
and Captain Quist, looking ruefully at a tall silk
hat, which lay battered in the roadway, and on
which some one must have fallen, muttered a familiar
phrase.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That comes,” said the Captain, “of gettin’ into
bad company.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />DR. CRIPPS IS INCOHERENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When that unfortunate and much battered football
of Fate—Dr. Cripps—was left, stranded and
alone, at Liverpool Street Station, he cast about in
his mind as to what was best to be done. His
small share of the spoils of the Sheffield robbery
had been passed into the hands of a person, who
had promised to effect a safe exchange; and Cripps
was, as usual, remarkably short of money.</p>

<p class='c009'>He remembered too, not with contrition, but with
something of alarm, that he had, in a moment of
forgetfulness, struck a man on a vital spot with a
decanter, and left him apparently dead; so that
there might be consequences to be feared. On
the other hand, money must be screwed out of
somebody, and he was at a loss to know to whom
to turn for it. Woolwich was barren country; for
the recent tragic events, and the stir created by the
bank robbery, had scattered the band, and it was
quite unlikely that he would have a chance of meeting
any member of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, the barren country had to be tried;
much liquid refreshment was necessary to him, and
it had to be obtained somewhere. Accordingly,
for nearly a week he haunted those shady, out-at-elbows
places near the river, in the hope of meeting
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>a friend. But friends were scarce and shy;
and, although he met one or two, and pleaded his
position successfully, it was hard and uphill work.
At the end of a week, he had come perilously near
to spirituous starvation—and was, in direct consequence,
more sober than he had been for years past.</p>

<p class='c009'>His wits being much sharpened, as his brain became
clearer, he began to think, with rising hope,
of Bamberton, from which he had so unceremoniously
taken flight. The idea appealed to him; with
growing confidence, he remembered, in these more
sober moments, that the man he had assaulted with
the decanter had had but a passing glimpse of him,
and might not be likely to recognise him. At all
events, the distance was not great, and the place
had a public-house—two public-houses, unless his
eyes had deceived him. Brightened with this
thought, and with the prospect of having a new
field in which to borrow, and finding that he had
sufficient money in his pocket to pay for the journey,
he set off for Liverpool Street; and, in a little
time, was standing—an incongruous figure enough
in the spring landscape—outside the little station
which was within a few miles of Bamberton, moistening
his dry lips with his tongue, and wondering
where he was to get a drink.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the days—over a quarter of a century before—when
Cripps had known Bamberton, the little
town where the railway now ended had been but
an insignificant village, and the railway (which had
made its fortune) a thing undreamt of. At the
present time, therefore, the Doctor stood on strange
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>ground; and the past was so far away, that he had
absolutely no idea in which direction Bamberton
lay. Divided between the necessity for reaching
the village, and the more pressing need for refreshment,
the little man looked about him for some
promising stranger, who might have a kindly heart
and a spare threepence in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Standing almost at his elbow, and staring down
the road, in altogether as gloomy a fashion as himself,
was a young man, quietly dressed in country
style—a mere lad. Cripps, after glancing at him
once or twice, edged towards him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose, my friend,” he said—“I suppose you
don’t happen to know the way towards Bamberton—do
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man looked at him for a moment, and
then smiled. “I ought to know the way, sir,” he
replied; “I was born there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a most excellent place to be born in, I
should imagine,” said Cripps. “Delightful scenery,
and—and a public-house or two, just—just to relieve
the monotony of things. Er—by the way—they
don’t seem to have one just about here—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just across the road,” replied the young man,
jerking his head in that direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cripps began to conceive a dislike for the
lad, as one who could not understand the true
meaning of a hint; but he tried again. “Is—is the
liquor there worth drinking?” he asked, in a confidential
tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a long time since I tried it,” replied the
young man carelessly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>Cripps saw an opening here; he laughed feebly,
and clapped the young man on the shoulder. “Ha—ha—very
good,” he cried—“very good indeed.
But you wouldn’t object to tasting it now, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man shrugged his shoulders, without
looking at Cripps, and made no reply. But the
little man, whose thirst was rapidly getting the
better of every other consideration, promptly seized
him by the arm, and began to lead him across the
road in a desperate hurry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall taste it, my young friend,” he cried,
in an ecstasy of good-fellowship. “Not—mind you—not
that I would have any young man follow in
my footsteps—for I, my young friend, am a wreck.
But a little stimulant—especially at this hour of
the day—(indeed, I might say, at any hour of the
day)—is very necessary; it gives tone to the constitution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It appeared to have given something besides tone
to the Doctor’s constitution; but he did not say so.
He walked with his new friend into the little Railway
Inn, and ordered refreshments for both; discovering,
to his dismay, when asked for the price
of them, that he had no money. He had performed
the same excellent trick so often, that he was an
adept at it; and tears of indignation actually sprang
to his eyes, as he solemnly cursed the unknown
man who must have stolen his purse—“containing
gold, sir—gold—and my dear and sainted mother’s
portrait—a miniature, sir, from which I would not
have parted, except at the sacrifice of my last drop
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>of blood. The gold, sir, was nothing—but the
miniature——” Here the old sinner hid his face
in the folds of a very doubtful-looking handkerchief,
and appeared to weep.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man, whatever his suspicions may have
been, was a good-natured fellow, and he paid the
reckoning. Immediately, the little man became all
smiles again, and raising his glass, insisted on drinking
the young man’s health.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If, my dear young friend, I could have the
privilege of knowing to whom I am indebted—I
should be glad; if I could pledge you by name——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My name’s Routley—Harry Routley,” replied
the lad. “Your health, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yours, Mr. Routley,” responded Cripps.
“Whatever station of life may be yours, sir, I am
convinced that it is a station you adorn. Bamberton
should be proud of you, Mr. Routley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry shrugged his shoulders, and laughed a
little bitterly. “At the present time,” he said—“neither
Bamberton nor any other place is particularly
proud of me, I think. And I have no distinct
position in life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a pity—a great pity,” said Cripps
gravely, shaking his head. “If a man has no
position, the devil is likely to find him one. My
young friend—I am sorry for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t be,” replied Harry, savagely. “It’s
my own fault—and my own business, if it comes to
that. I deserve everything I get. I sold the best
man and the best master ever a lad had—and I
don’t care what becomes of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>“Sold a man!” exclaimed Cripps. “I don’t understand
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t suppose you do,” replied Harry, recklessly.
“Maybe, not belonging to these parts, you
haven’t heard of Mr. Dandy Chater—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The unfortunate Cripps, with a gasp, dropped his
glass to the floor, and fled. But, before he had
managed to wrench open the door, Harry had laid
a strong hand on his shoulder, and was hauling him
back again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go—let me go!” cried Cripps wildly.
“I won’t be pestered with that devilish name any
more. Let me go! I’ve found him in the river;
he’s got the diamond necklace; he’s got the bank-notes;
he’s frightened the Count and myself out of
our senses; and I can’t have a quiet drink with a
stranger, without hearing of him again. Let me go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop a bit,” said Harry quickly, with his carelessness
and reckless demeanour gone—“stop a bit!
What do you know of Dandy Chater?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A great deal too much,” said the Doctor, shaking
his head, and looking all about him. “What do you
know about him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was his servant,” replied Harry, casting down
his eyes, and speaking in a low voice. “And I—I
betrayed him, and handed him over to the police.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little Doctor looked at Harry for some
moments with great gravity, and then shook his
head at him reproachfully. “My young friend—my
dear young friend,”—he became quite melancholy
over him—“it’s very evident to me that you
are on the downward path—in the very devil’s
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>clutches. You’ve been dreaming. Dandy Chater
is as dead as Pharoah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God forbid!” exclaimed Harry, turning very
white. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy Chater was drowned—a week or two
back—in that noble stream, the Thames.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry burst into a roar of laughter. “A week
or two back,” he exclaimed. “You must be out of
your mind! Why, he’s been down here within
these past few days—has been in Chelmsford Jail,
to stand his trial for murder; and is now at large
about the country somewhere—God be good to him,
wherever he is—with the police hunting high and
low for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps sat down suddenly on a bench. “Would
you be so kind—so very kind, young man—as to call
for a little drop of brandy—neat?” he said, in a
shaky voice. “I’ve been persuading myself, for the
last week, that I’d dreamed it all; and now I find
that it’s all true.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry called for the brandy and Cripps swallowed
it, murmuring to himself, over and over again as he
set down the empty glass—“Dandy Chater in the
river—Dandy Chater got the necklace—Dandy
Chater in Chelmsford Jail—Dandy Chater running
about the country, with the police after him. And
Ogledon said that he——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He checked himself hurriedly there and got up.
“You are a most estimable young man,” he said,
addressing Harry—“and I would recommend you
to drink as little as possible, and not to see more
Dandy Chaters than you can help at once. Now, if
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>you are going towards Bamberton, perhaps you’ll be
good enough to put me on my road.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry expressing his willingness to do so, the
two went out of the inn together, and set off. For
a long time, they walked in silence; but the Doctor’s
mind was busy. Perhaps the mere fact of coming
again in daylight among old well-remembered scenes
jogged that blurred and faded thing, his memory;
perhaps the sight, in the distance, of the towers of
Chater Hall helped it still more. Whatever it may
have been, he suddenly stopped in the road, just
before they came to the village and clapped his
hands together, with a cry; burst into a shriek of
laughter; and began to dance and caper wildly
about in the dust. Harry fully convinced, that the
man had suddenly gone mad, backed away from him
and stood ready to defend himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho—ho—ho—!” screamed the Doctor, slapping
his thighs, punching himself in the ribs, and still
dancing as wildly as ever—“here’s a joke! Here’s
a business! Here’s a topsy-turvy devilish upside-down
affair! Ho—ho—ho—! It’s the other child;
it’s the twin that was smuggled away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry, feeling at last that the man was serious,
and that his disjointed remarks had a meaning
which the other could not fathom, sprang at him,
shook him, and demanded to know what he meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you idiots!—you blunderers!” Cripps was
still laughing boisterously. “Don’t you see that
there are two of them? One dead—t’other
living!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Further than that, he would say nothing; he
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>still continued to dance about in the dust, and to
clap his hands, and to shriek with laughter, and to
shout, over and over again, that one was dead and
t’other living. Harry, filled with repentance for
the trouble he had brought upon his master, and
keenly anxious to do all in his power to undo the
wrong he felt he had committed, began to feel that
this man might know something concerning Dandy
Chater which would be useful—that he might be
able, in some strange way, to save the man against
whom that fearful charge of murder had been made.
Looking at him, Harry began to wonder what to
do; how to force from this man the information he
probably held. Feeling his own weakness in the
matter, he cast about in his mind to discover to
whom he might turn for help.</p>

<p class='c009'>He must find, in the first place, a friend of the
man he desired to assist—some one about whose
loyalty to Dandy Chater there could be no faintest
doubt. The name of one person after another occurred
to him—only to be immediately rejected, as
an avowed believer in his guilt, or as too weak to
be of use. Suddenly there came the thought of
Miss Barnshaw—the woman who loved Dandy
Chater—who was rich, and had powerful friends;
he decided to go to her at once, and to take Cripps
with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>To go to her was easy enough; to take the little
man was another matter. For Cripps already began
to repent of having said anything to a stranger,
even in the natural excitement attending the discovery
he felt he had made; on Harry suggesting,
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>with much eagerness, that they should go together
to see Miss Barnshaw, he at once became very
grave again, and resolutely shook his head. Visions
of Ogledon—of the body he had assisted to drag
from the river—of many other things—floated before
him; he decided to hold his tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feeling, however, on second thoughts, that it
might be possible that this young and rich lady
would be willing to assist so forlorn an outcast,
in need of considerable refreshment, he at length
consented to accompany the lad to her house; and
was hurried along, at a most undignified pace, by
Harry, immediately his consent had been obtained.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry stipulated that he should first see the
young lady alone, in order to prepare her for whatever
communication Cripps might have to make;
and that gentleman, complying with so reasonable
a request, took a seat in the hall, while Harry was
shown into the presence of Madge, who was alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>There, his courage and resolution began to fail
him at once—the more so, that she came eagerly towards
him, with a flush on her face, and with her
eyes lit up with a faint hope that he had news for
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Harry; what have you to tell me?”
she asked, quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to be fair and just, Miss,” he said; “I
want to undo some of the wrong I have done, and
have so bitterly repented of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What wrong?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry hung his head a little lower. “I sold
Master Dandy, Miss; I gave him up to the police,
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>when he might have escaped; I put them on his
track.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You! But I thought——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes, Miss,” he said bitterly, glancing up at
her—“I know what you thought; I know what
every one thought. You believed that I loved him,
and was devoted to him. So I was; I would have
died for him; I would die now to undo what I did
that night. But I was mad, Miss Barnshaw; I felt
that he had done me a wrong, and I forgot—forgot
all the rest. But now—now I want to put things
right—to help him if I can—to prove his innocence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—yes—he is innocent, Harry; there can be
no question about that,” she said firmly. “I believe
that with all my heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so do I, Miss Barnshaw,” replied the lad.
“I feel now that he could never have struck down
an unprotected girl—I know that, whatever mystery
there may be about it all, the Master Dandy we
know could never have done that deed. And there
is a man here, Miss, a man I met by accident, who
knows him, and who has some strange story to tell
about him. I could make nothing of it myself, so
I brought him here, in the hope that you would see
him, Miss, and try to get the story from him. He
has been babbling about twins—and there being
two of them (two Dandy Chaters, he seemed to
mean, Miss)—and one dead, and the other living.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him in perplexity for a moment,
and then, following the direction of his eyes, and of
a hasty movement he made towards the door, opened
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>it swiftly, and looked into the hall. She beckoned
to Cripps, who got up somewhat diffidently, and
came into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had had time to think about the matter while
he sat alone in the hall. Having a deadly fear of
Ogledon, and of his own connection with those
shady characters at Woolwich, he had come to
the conclusion that the less he said the better
would it be for him. At the same time, he wanted
money; and, if this woman wanted information, she
must pay for it, no matter how meagre that information
might be. Putting on an air of deep humility,
he faced the girl, hat in hand, and waited for
her to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am told,” she said at last, in a low voice, “that
you have something to tell me, concerning Mr.
Dandy Chater—something that may help him—perhaps
save him from the fate which seems to be
sweeping down upon him. Will you tell me what
you know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps moistened his lips with his tongue—looked
all round the room—looked into his hat—and finally
raised his eyes to her face. “Owing to circumstances
I cannot explain, my dear young lady,” he
said, in his weak treble—“I run a very great risk
in telling you anything; so great a risk that—I
hardly know how to put the matter—that it will be
necessary for you—or any one else—to make it
worth my while to say anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you can help him—if you can tell me anything
of service—you shall be paid liberally,” she
responded eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>The weak eyes of the little man twinkled and he
moistened his lips again. “I want—say fifty
pounds?” he hazarded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is yours. Tell me what you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like”—he hesitated, and turned his hat
round and round—“I should like an open cheque—first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She went straight to a desk in a corner of the
room; was busy for a moment; and then looked
round at him. “To whom shall I make it payable?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cripps is my name—Dr. J. Cripps, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She brought him the piece of paper, and he read
it greedily and thrust it in his pocket; seemed to
hesitate a little longer; and finally said what he had
made up his mind to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear young lady—I am not usually sober
enough to give a clear opinion upon anything; force
of circumstances has kept me sober for nearly a
week, and I am clearer about the head than usual. I
can only say this: to the best of my knowledge and
belief, there are two Dandy Chaters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two!” she echoed, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two. One was fished out of the Thames some
days ago, and has been buried as an unknown man;
the other is in Chelmsford Jail—or wandering about
the country—I don’t know which. I only know
that there are two of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—great heavens, man,” she cried—“I have
known one Dandy Chater since his boyhood; we
have grown up side by side. What other man can
there be in his likeness?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>“I don’t care anything about that,” said the Doctor,
obstinately, “and I’m not going to tell you
more. I know that there are two—that one is dead,
and t’other living; that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my good man—I implore you to relieve my
anxiety. Can’t you see my position? Which of
these men is it who committed the murder of which
the living one is accused; and which has been my
friend—and my lover?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Doctor shook his head helplessly. “The
Lord only knows,” he said; “<i>I</i> don’t!”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />OGLEDON PLAYS HIS LAST CARD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Philip Chater, after being tumbled so unceremoniously
out of the fly, lost no time in scrambling
to his feet, with the aid of Captain Quist and the
man of the melancholy visage. He found some difficulty
in getting up on his own account, by reason
of the handcuffs which still adorned his wrists. The
Captain, now that his first lament was over concerning
the wonderful silk hat, picked up the wreckage
of his headgear out of the dust, and became in a moment
the resolute man of action.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phil, my lad,” he said, briskly—“we ’aven’t got
a moment to throw away. At the rate that there
’oss is a goin’, they’ll be in Chelmsford, with the
town roused, in about ’arf an hour; and then they’ll
begin ter scour the country, if yer like. Luckily it’s
dark, an’ the moon ain’t a showin’ ’er face as much
as she was; so we’ll cut straight across these ’ere
fields, an’ lie close for a bit at the circus. Lor’—wot
a lucky thing it is that I took to ’osses an’ sawdust!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip was hurried along so rapidly, and assisted
over stiles and through gates and hedges at such a
pace, that he found it quite impossible to ask any
questions. The Captain kept an arm tightly locked
in his, as though he feared Philip might escape again,
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>on his own account; while the melancholy man
scouted in advance, on the lookout for possible surprises.
In this order, after going at a great rate
for some half hour or so, they came to a place where
a few lights were gleaming among trees, and some
shadowy figures moving to and fro. In the pale
light of the moon, a huge tent stood up as a background
to the picture, the front of which was occupied
by one or two smaller tents, and a couple of
caravans. Without stopping for anything, the Captain
dived in amongst these, pulled open the door
of one of the caravans, and motioned to Philip to
go in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The place was dimly lighted by a little oil lamp
hung at one side; Philip recognised it, at the first
glance, as the caravan in which he had escaped from
Chelmsford. The Captain and the melancholy man
following him in, the latter closed the door carefully,
while the former produced from a little
locker, various bottles and glasses with a smiling
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a word, Phil, my boy,” said the Captain, in
a hoarse whisper—“till sich time as you gets a drop
of summink warmin’ inside yer. You’ve ’ad sich an
uncommonly lively time lately, an’ ’ave bin tumbled
about to that extent, as it’s a marvel ter me if you
’ave any system left at all. So down with it, Phil,
my lad—with the noble sentiment—(I feels like a
boy-pirate meself!)—‘Confusion to the perlice!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am more grateful to you, old friend, than I
can say,” said Philip, “and, if I can get these
bracelets off, I shall be able to drink, or to do anything
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>else with greater ease. However, I’ll drink
to the toast with all my heart.” He raised the
glass in both his manacled hands, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll ’ave them little ornyments orf in ’arf a
jiffy,” said the Captain, diving into the locker
again. “We guessed you might ’ave summink of
that sort, as a little delicate attention from your
friends—so we got pervided accordin’. ’Ere’s a file
from our ’andy-man’s tool-bag; an’ I reckon I’d best
’ave a go at the rivets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain set to work at once; nor would he
utter a word, in reply to any questions, until the
handcuffs were removed. It took some considerable
time, and while the filing went on, Philip
noticed that the melancholy man kept his eyes fixed
upon the floor—only occasionally indulging in that
extraordinary cough, with which he had been
afflicted at the Chater Arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, the handcuffs being safely put out of
sight, the Captain, turning to the melancholy man,
said abruptly—“Now then, Skerritt, my boy—let’s
know ’ow this ’ere affair was brought orf for the
infermation of Mr. Chater. This, Phil,” he added,
“is a man as is to be trusted with anythink—from
untold gold to w’iskey—a man as formerly sailed
under me, an’ ’as joined me, as a sort of depitty
clown. I’ll own,” added the Captain, in a hoarse
whisper behind his hand to Philip—“I’ll own as ’e
don’t look it—but ’e’s got a way with ’im, w’en ’e’s
painted up, as would fairly astonish yer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Skerritt immediately plunged into an account
of his doings, and of how he contrived to meet
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>Philip; explaining it all with many of those curious
sounds before referred to, and with much rolling of
one melancholy eye. He had a curious funereal
voice, as though it had sunk below the usual level
at some period, of great depression, and had never
been got up again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Cap’n ’avin’ passed the word as there were
a shipmate in distress, I started out fer ter sight
’im; got wind that ’e might be expected in Bamberton—wind
an’ tide bein’, so ter speak, favourable.
The Cap’n ’ere come as far as the cross-roads wi’ me
an’ we arranged signals. Then I ’eard a fair rumpus
in the village, an’ got up jus’ in time to see the perliceman
a bein’ pounded in the ribs by a ole gent in
his stockin’ feet, an’ Mr. Chater a layin’ about
proper among the lubbers as was a tryin’ to ’old ’im.
I shoves meself for’ard, an’ manages ter git with
’im an’ the perliceman, w’en they starts fer Chelmsford.
The rest ’e knows.” Here Mr. Skerritt
laughed again, in that peculiar fashion of his, and
looked more melancholy than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Captain,” urged Philip—“you don’t seem
to realise what a risk you run, in thus defying the
Law, and befriending a man who is an outlaw.
My debt to you is greater than I can pay; and I
cannot permit you to run any further danger on my
account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Old ’ard—’old ’ard, mess-mate,” cried the Captain.
“’Osses or no ’osses—circuses or no circuses—I
stan’ by a friend. I confess I don’t understan’
the business—an’ I don’t like you a runnin’ under
false colours; but you’ve give me yer word as ’ow
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>you’re innocent; an’ I’ll continue for to rescue yer,
once a week, if necessary—till further orders. I
don’t take no notice of objections or risks; rescue
yer I will, agin yer will or with it. An’ now, Phil,
as we starts early to-morrer mornin’, I’d advise yer
to turn in, an’ git wot sleep yer can. An’ in order
that yer may sleep with a easy mind, there’s some
one as I’d like yer ter see, afore I battens yer down
for the night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, the worthy Captain opened the door
cautiously, and crept down the steps. In a few
moments, the door was opened again, by another
hand; and a light figure darted in, and fell at
Philip’s feet. It was Clara Siggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was so astonished and so delighted at this
unexpected meeting, that, as he raised her from the
floor, and looked into her eyes, he bent his head,
and kissed her, quite on an impulse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear girl,” he said—“this is the best part of
all—to know that you are safe and well, and in good
hands. Tell me—how did you come here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Quist, with whom I lodged at Chelmsford,
gave up her house, and came to join the Captain.
She has made up her mind to travel about in
future with her husband—to look after him a little,
I fancy”—Clara laughed softly as she spoke—“and
so I came with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw your mother a few hours since,” said
Philip, watching the girl intently as he spoke—“and
assured her that you were with friends, and
well cared for. When will you return to her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked up at him quickly for a moment, with
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>a half reproachful expression on her face. “When
you tell me to go,” she said, slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—not when <i>I</i> tell you, child; but when your
own heart tells you. I wouldn’t have you think me
ungrateful, for the world; I wouldn’t have you
think that I undervalue, in any way, your sacrifice
for me, or your valuable help in my time of greatest
need; I shall remember it all, while God gives
me memory to remember anything. But I should
be a brute and a coward, if I took advantage of it—or
of you. You are very young, and have, I trust, a
long and happy life before you; my life seems to be
going down in shadows. More than all else, I want
you to think that the Dandy Chater who lingered
with you in the woods, and whispered foolish
things to you, is not the Dandy Chater who holds
your hands now, and speaks to you out of a full and
grateful heart. Perhaps—who can tell, child?—perhaps
trouble and suffering have altered him—have
made him see many things in a better light;
perhaps he’s a different man altogether.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was weeping quietly, with her head bowed
down on the hands he held; but she did not interrupt
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s an old mother at home, waiting to welcome
back the pretty child she brought into the
world, and has held so often in her arms; there’s a
grey-headed father, who loves you; and there’s
some one else—a good-hearted lad, with never a
stain upon him—who loves you, too, as you deserve
to be loved. Now—when does your heart tell you
you must go back to them?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>“I—I understand,” she said, almost in a whisper.
“I’ve had time to think, during these few days—and
this wild and foolish heart of mine seems to
beat for them—for him—more than it ever did before.
I should like to go back to them at once—to-morrow—now
that I know you are safe. But
will they understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mother will understand everything,” said
Philip, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>For three days, Philip Chater remained with the
circus—keeping hidden during the day, and only
venturing out at night. During that time, he had
some narrow escapes from re-capture; once, he lay
under a tarpaulin which had been flung hurriedly
over him, and heard a constable making minute enquiries
concerning the missing Dandy Chater, while
Captain Peter Quist gave as minute replies. Realising,
however, that he could not remain hidden
much longer, and being fully aware of the risk
which was run so cheerfully by the Captain, and
those associated with him, he determined to get
away, and to let what risk and danger there was be
upon his own shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew well, however, that the Captain would
never consent to his departure; and would be mortally
offended at the mere suggestion of such a
thing. Therefore, he determined to steal away,
without giving any warning of his intention. Clara
Siggs, under a safe escort, had gone back to Bamberton;
and the circus was already making arrangements
to move on further afield.</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly, quite late at night, when all the
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>people connected with the circus were sleeping, he
started to make his escape. He had absolutely refused
to occupy the caravan originally intended for
him, because he knew that, by so doing, the Captain
and Mrs. Quist would be rendered practically
homeless; after much contention about the matter,
it had been arranged that he should sleep in a rough
tent, and in the company of the melancholy one.
And, on this night, he lay wide awake in the darkness,
listening to the heavy breathing of that gentleman,
and striving to make up his mind what course
to pursue, when once he should be clear of the little
encampment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately, the melancholy man was a heavy
sleeper, and Philip was able to creep past him, and
get out of the tent, under the stars, without rousing
him or any one else. Standing there, in the
silence of the night, with only those faint points
of light glimmering and winking above him, and
no sound all about, save the distant barking of a
dog, Philip wondered what he should do—to what
point of the compass he should turn. So far as
he knew, he stood absolutely alone, with all his
battles still to fight. But even now, with a full
knowledge of the dangers through which he had
passed, and the dangers he had still to face, Bamberton—the
scene of all his troubles—drew him
like a magnet.</p>

<p class='c009'>The circus had moved on, some fifteen miles to
the westward of the village; but Philip had kept
careful note of the route taken, and was able to set
out at once, by the most direct road. There was
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>but small fear of his meeting any one, in the middle
of the night; but, for all that, he was watchful and
suspicious of every sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>He made straight for the Chater Arms, and
reached it at about five o’clock in the morning;
lying concealed at a little distance, he waited until
he saw Betty herself throw open her window, and
show her blooming face to the fresh morning sun;
creeping near, he signalled to her, and in a few moments
she appeared at the door leading into the
yard, and beckoned to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before a word was spoken, she drew him inside,
and hugged him in her hearty fashion, and wept a
little in quite a womanly one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Clara is with you?” was his first question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—an’ as well as well. But, my dear boy,
wot brings yer back to Bamberton?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip hurriedly explained his reasons for leaving
Captain Quist—reasons which Betty cordially approved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t need to worry yerself a bit, deary,”
she said—“’cos that there idjut Tokely ’as took ’isself
back to Scotland Yard—an’ there ain’t nobody
in the ’ouse, ’cept a drunken little wretch wot seems
to ’ave plenty of money, an’ is goin’ on in a fair
way to empty my bar. An’ of all the strange
things”—she stopped suddenly, and looked at
Philip, and clapped her hands together; “Phil,
dear lad,—to think that you an’ ’im should ’ave
come together, at this time, in this place, an’ with
ole Betty under the same roof!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip stared at her in astonishment. “Why,
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>little mother”—he said, laughing—“what on earth
are you rambling on about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not ramblin’ at all, deary—but jus’ speakin’ of
plain honest facts. The man who’s sleepin’ upstairs
now is a chap—a Doctor—by the name of
Cripps——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not the Cripps of whom you told me, Betty!”
cried Philip, excitedly. “Not the man who was
paid to keep the secret of my birth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very same,” cried Betty, with equal excitement.
“Why—Phil, dear lad——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t waste a moment, Betty,” he cried—“I
must see this man at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But ’e’s in bed—an’ sleepin’ like a pig; it took
Toby an’ another man to get ’im upstairs las’ night—an’
’e fought all the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care if he’s in bed—or where he is,” said
Philip—“I must see him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Persuaded at last that the matter was really
urgent, Betty led the way upstairs—pointed to a
door—and hurriedly retired. Philip Chater, after
knocking once, and getting no response, turned the
handle and went in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Cripps must have gone to bed, as suggested
by Betty Siggs, in a state of considerable excitement.
His dilapidated clothing was literally all
over the room, as though he had stripped it from
his person, and hurled it in all directions. He was
hanging half out of bed, as though he had made a
vain attempt to stand on his head on the floor, and
had fallen asleep before accomplishing it; so that
his countenance, at all times an inflamed one, was
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>literally purple. Philip, in his impatience, hurried
towards him, shook him into an upright position,
and spoke his name.</p>

<p class='c009'>The unfortunate Cripps, awakened thus hurriedly
from his slumbers, and having no time to collect
his thoughts properly, saw before him the man who
had been the cause of all his miseries and troubles,
and remembered nothing of that solution of the
mystery at which he had so opportunely arrived.
Indeed, the fifty pounds he had earned—or obtained—from
Madge Barnshaw was going far to
make him a greater wreck than before; for he was
melting it into a liquid form, as rapidly as mortal
man could.</p>

<p class='c009'>Staring, in those first moments of semi-consciousness,
into the eyes of Dandy Chater, as he supposed,
he beat him off with both hands, shrieked
aloud, and made for the window. Philip had only
just time to catch him round the waist; in another
moment, he would have gone head first into the
yard below.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Steady, my friend—steady!” exclaimed Philip,
putting the terror-stricken man into a chair, and
getting between him and the window. “What are
you frightened at? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps looked at him for a moment or two, and
then his face gradually changed. “You came—came
on a man so suddenly,” he said. “But I see
now; I suppose you’re the other one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip laughed. “Yes,” he said—“I’m the other
one. You know all about me, Cripps; you know
that I’m a fugitive from justice—and you know,
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>better than any one, that I am innocent, and am
suffering for my brother’s sins. I suppose you know
that he is dead?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps nodded. “Fished him out of the river
myself, with a beastly sailor-man, who dragged me
into it by sheer brute force,” he replied. “And,
ever since then, you’ve been appearing to me as a
ghost—and frightening me out of what few wits I
have left. Now—what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First,” said Philip, sitting down near him—“I
want to assure you that I am your friend; I want
to plead with you to help me—to work with me
to bring this business to an end. Who knows the
real story, except yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one,” said Cripps after a moment’s thought—“except
the woman who took you to Australia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she will say nothing, I know,” replied
Philip. “Now there is a man—a cousin of mine—named
Ogledon——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps shook a feeble fist in the air. “Ogledon
is a scoundrel—a devil,” he cried. “Ask him how
Dandy Chater—your brother, mind you—met his
death?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you know anything of that, Dr. Cripps—in
mercy tell me!” exclaimed Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ogledon killed him; that much I know, from
his own lips,” said the little man, after a pause.
“You see, you have taken his place so neatly, that
it has never occurred to anybody to imagine that
Dandy is dead. I was always sorry for Dandy—oh—don’t
laugh at me; I’m a drunken little creature,
of no good to any one—but Dandy would
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>have been all right, if it hadn’t have been for Ogledon.
Ogledon took him, when he was a mere lad,
and moulded him as he would. And then killed
him to finish it. But there’s worse than that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Worse!” cried Philip. “What do you mean?
What can be worse than that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know a young girl named Marnham?
No—Barnham—Barn——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Barnshaw?” asked Philip, with his heart beginning
to beat uncomfortably fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Barnshaw it is. Lives at a house near here.
Well—Ogledon’s been sweet on her for a long time,
although, from what I hear, she would have nothing
to say to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven bless her! I should think not, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—Ogledon made up his mind to get hold
of her; he has sent her an urgent message to go to
him, on the plea that he can explain about you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“About me?” said Philip, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—or rather about Dandy Chater. That was
the message: ‘I can tell you the truth about Dandy
Chater.’ At least, so the Shady ’un told me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Shady ’un? What has he to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything. He has been trusted by Ogledon
with the message; I saw him this very afternoon,
when he came in here to enquire the way—having
missed it somehow or other. And Miss Barnshaw
has gone back with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater drew a deep breath. “Steady
now, Cripps; let’s have this thing straight. You
say the Shady ’un has taken Miss Barnshaw to
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>Ogledon. Where is Ogledon? Where are they to
meet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At a hut on the river bank, near The Three
Watermen,” replied Cripps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where Dandy Chater met his death!” muttered
Philip to himself. “Cripps, get into your clothes;
we’ll follow them at once!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />DANDY CHATER COMES FROM THE GRAVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Cripps—partly from excitement, partly from
sheer vindictiveness against Ogledon—was only too
ready for the expedition. Indeed, both men were
so eager for it, though each for a different reason,
that Philip almost forgot the caution that was
necessary, in his own case; he would have started
off, in broad daylight that very hour, to track
down the man of whom he was in search, had not
Cripps pointed out to him the madness of such a
course.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, my dear Chater,” he said—“you’ll get
me into trouble, as well as yourself; it’s a dangerous
thing to be running about the country with a
notorious criminal—I beg that you will excuse the
expression; but you really are a bit notorious, you
know—and I have no wish to appear in the dock,
for anything beyond my own private sins—and they
are heavy enough, Heaven knows. So that, if I
might suggest, I think it would be wiser for us to
smuggle you to London, in some way or other—that
is, if you are really resolved on going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I am resolved,” cried Philip, eagerly;
“nothing shall turn me back. Cripps, I won’t believe
you are so bad as men have painted you, or
made you—or as you have made yourself. There’s
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>a heart in you somewhere, and all the brandy in the
world hasn’t washed it out of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” said Cripps, in a low voice; and
hung his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me tell you this; that I love this girl with
all my heart and soul; she is in danger—and I know
that Ogledon will not hesitate to add another crime
to his list. The question is (for you are right about
the necessity for smuggling me) how am I to get to
London?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They decided to consult Betty Siggs forthwith;
and, although that lady was at first very chary of
holding any communication with Cripps, she cheerfully
accepted Philip’s assurance that the little man
was to be trusted, and set about devising a plan to
help them. Taking Toby into her confidence, also,
she brought him up to the room, where Philip and
Cripps were waiting, and they put the case before
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toby Siggs thought about it for a long time;
turned it over this way and that, but could make
nothing of it. Betty, after all, settled the difficulty
in her own quick fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>She happened to be standing near the window,
looking down into the yard at the back of the inn;
when she suddenly clapped her hands, and laughed
aloud. “’Ere you are!” she exclaimed—“the very
thing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip ran to her side, and looked down into the
yard. A heavy wagon, laden with hay, had drawn
into the yard, and the carter was at that moment
climbing down, ready to enter the house.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>“See, dear lad,” whispered Betty—“the man is a
stranger, and ’alf a sov’rin will be a fortune to ’im,
an’ ’e’ll ask no questions. You ain’t above roughing
it—an’ you an’ the other man can creep in under
the tarpaulin, and get to town, without no one bein’
any the wiser. It’ll be slow—but it’ll be better
than bein’ caught ’arf-way, an’ ’avin’ yer journey
for nothin’—won’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The plan seemed an excellent one; and Betty
went downstairs at once to arrange it. The carter,
being an easy fellow, earning small wages, was
delighted at the prospect of gathering in ten shillings
with so little trouble; and, in half an hour
Cripps and Philip Chater were lying snugly on top
of the sweet-smelling hay, under the tarpaulin,
travelling slowly but surely on the road to
London.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps was very valiant—in whispers—on the
road; professing his ability to run Ogledon to
earth, and openly charge him with the murder of
Dandy Chater. Repentance was strong upon him
for the time, and he was ready to perform impossible
deeds, by way of reparation for past misdeeds.
In particular, he was anxious about the bank notes
which had been handed to Philip at The Three
Watermen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For of course I know, by this time, Mr. Chater,
that they were handed to you,” he said—“and not
to the man who is dead. Let me warn you, for
your own sake, not to deal in them; they are
stopped, and keenly watched for already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The warning comes too late,” replied Philip,
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>with a groan. “I dealt in them almost at once. I
had to cover up a—well, call it a mistake—on the
part of my late brother, and I paid away the notes
as hush-money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To whom did you pay it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To a money-lender—a man bearing the distinctive
name of Isaacson,” replied Philip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds bad,” said the little man. “He
would be sure to find out about the notes before
any one. Have you heard nothing from him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How should I? I have not been to Chater
Hall since that time; Heaven knows how many
letters may be waiting for me—or for Dandy Chater.
At all events, it’s no use worrying about it, or wondering
what is going to happen within the next
twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cart in which they travelled was heavily
laden, and slow; and the carter stopped many
times upon the road, on the strength of the ten shillings
he had received, for refreshment. They
chafed at the delay, but could do nothing; for they
dared not express impatience, for fear of arousing
suspicion. Worse than all, from the Doctor’s standpoint,
at least, it was impossible for them to stir
from under the tarpaulin, or to show themselves;
so that, through the dust and heat of many hours,
they had the melancholy satisfaction of seeing the
carter bury his face in huge tankards of ale,
whilst nothing came their way. At such moments
as these, the Doctor buried <i>his</i> face in the hay, and
positively groaned aloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite late in the afternoon, when they
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>came into London, and the cart was hacked into a
huge stable-yard. There, another delay occurred;
for night was still far off, and they dared not stir
in daylight. Fortunately, the hay was not to be
disturbed until the next morning, so that they lay
there, listening to the busy noise of the streets, and
longing for darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dusk at last, and the noises in the streets growing
fainter. They had agreed upon their plan of
action, and had decided to take a four-wheeled cab
to Woolwich—choosing that conveyance, as being
likely to attract less attention than a hansom—and
then to walk to The Three Watermen. They slipped
down the side of the hay wagon, and crept out of
the stable-yard into the streets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip dived into the first crawling “growler” he
saw, leaving Cripps to give the necessary directions.
Philip leaned back in the cab, as much out of sight
as possible, and began to wonder, with fiery impatience,
whether they would be too late—or whether
they would miss those of whom they were in pursuit—or
whether Madge had really come to London,
and, if so, where she was at that time.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a long journey through endless streets,
Cripps stopped the vehicle, and they alighted.
Philip found himself at the corner of a narrow and
very dirty street, in a neighbourhood evidently of
the poorest class—and yet a neighbourhood which
seemed familiar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mr. Chater,” said the little man, who was
evidently growing more nervous at every step they
took—“Now comes the necessity for greater caution
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>than ever. We—we may absolutely ruin
everything, if we are too precipitate. We must
find out first where Ogledon is, and whether or not
he has gone to the hut spoken of by the Shady ’un.
Ah—you don’t know what Ogledon is—or what he
is capable of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can guess,” said Philip, quietly—“and that
makes me the more anxious to get on without delay.
How far are we from the place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A hundred yards or so,” replied Cripps, who
was beginning to tremble like a leaf. “You don’t—don’t
feel that you would like—like to turn back,
I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Turn back!” cried Philip with a grim laugh.
“Turn back now—when I am within touch of this
man! No—not if greater dangers than any I have
met yet fronted me. Show me the way, wherever
it may be!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Doctor led the way down a side street,
which brought them, with another sharp turn to
the left to The Three Watermen; Philip knew it in
a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know the way now,” he said—“I have been
to the spot before. Come on—let us waste no further
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In his eagerness, he dived himself into that small
alley-way, into which he had gone on that first
night of his coming to the place. Only when he
reached the end of it, did he look round for his
companion; but Cripps was gone. His fears had
been too much for him, and, watching his opportunity,
he had fled. There was no time to wait for
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>him, or to look for him; Philip made his way rapidly
in the direction of those tumble-down out-houses
he had noticed on the night he found his brother’s
body.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coming within sight of these, he suddenly
stopped, and dropped down behind the shelter of a
ruined boat, which lay half buried in the mud. For,
at the door of one of those dilapidated buildings,
stood the Shady ’un, as if on guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Probably Mr. Shadrach Nottidge had never been
so surprised or terrified in all his life, as he was
when a figure suddenly sprang up before him, and
he felt himself caught by the throat, with a grip
which threatened to choke him with the least possible
delay. And, when he looked into the eyes of
Philip Chater, and remembered how much cause
that gentleman had for wreaking vengeance upon
him, by reason of the treachery he had displayed in
handing him over to the police, his fears were increased
a thousand-fold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now—you sly sneaking villain,” whispered
Philip between his teeth—“you runner and crawler
for other rogues—where’s your master?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shady ’un, wholly unable to speak, by reason
of that grip upon his throat, faintly moved his
head in the direction of the hut.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the lady you brought here with him?” asked
Philip, in the same cautious voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shady ’un contrived to nod, and to screw his
head again in the direction of the door; Philip,
glancing at it, saw that it stood some two inches
open. Giving the Shady ’un one final squeeze and
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>shake, he flung him away, so that he fell on his
back on the mud—gently pushed open the door—and
crept in. The Shady ’un, the instant that
Philip had disappeared into the hut, got slowly to
his feet, and then scurried away in the darkness towards
the streets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inside the hut, Philip found himself in a maze of
poles, and ropes, and planks, and dusty tattered
sails; gliding among these—(the shed had evidently
belonged to a boat-builder, and had long been
abandoned)—he peered past them into the shed itself,
where a faint light glimmered.</p>

<p class='c009'>As his eyes became accustomed to the twilight
of the place, he saw that the light in it came from
a guttering candle, thrust into the neck of a bottle,
and stood upon a table. Near this table, and at
the further end of the room, stood Madge Barnshaw.
At the side of it nearest to where Philip
stood concealed, and with his back towards the
door, stood Ogledon. With his hands clasped behind
his back, and his head thrust forward towards the
girl, he seemed to menace her, even while he was
silent. And yet, though he seemed to have her at
his mercy, he had about him a dogged air of being
at bay himself, and desperate. From the first
words Philip heard, as he stood there in the darkness
watching them, it appeared that Madge had
only just reached the place, and was still ignorant
of the full extent of her own danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You sent for me in desperate haste, Mr.
Ogledon,” she said—“to tell me about Dandy
Chater—to tell me the truth about him.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>“Yes—I’ll tell you all the truth about Dandy
Chater,” he said, sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have taken a long journey, in the full hope
that you might help him—that you might show me
a way to prove his innocence, and set him free,”
she said, in the same earnest pleading voice. “If
you can do that—if you will help him—I will bless
you from the depths of my grateful heart; I will
believe that you are true and kind and generous;
and I will beg you to forget any harsh thing I may
ever have said to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He moved nearer to the table, and leant his
hands upon it, and looked at her across the flickering
candle-light. “I have read somewhere,” he
said, slowly—“in some book made for babes and
sucklings—that the love of a woman will make an
angel of a man—and raise him up, and exalt him.
It’s a lie; no such thing ever happened. So far as
I have loved, the love of a woman is a thing
wherein are bound up hatred and bitterness and
murder—and every devil-made thing that belongs
to the darkness. They talk of a woman scorned;
what think you of a man scorned? What think
you of a man, who—eating his heart out for one
smile—one word of tenderness from a mere slip of
a girl—is met by looks which show him only disgust
and repugnance? You thought it a fine thing
to fling aside the love of a man like myself, and
take up with a mere boy—didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never flung aside your love,” replied the
girl, scornfully. “I told you, from the first,
that I could not care for you—that I loved some
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>one else. Had you been a gentleman—even a
man——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A gentleman!” he sneered. “What has gentility
to do with this business? It’s a question between
a man and a woman—and you shall find that
the man wins. Oh—my pretty maid—I swore a
long time ago that no other man should stand between
you and myself; I swore that I would have
you, and would bend you as it pleased me—or break
you. Yes—you’ve roused a lurking devil in me—and
I’ll stick at nothing now. First—let us understand
each other, in regard to Dandy Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took a turn or two about the room, with his
head bent, as though undecided what to say, or
what to leave unsaid. At last, going to his former
position near the table and standing there, he began
to say what he had to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You loved Dandy Chater—oh—don’t interrupt
me; you would say you love him still, I suppose?—I
knew that, from your own lips, as well as from
what I saw and heard when you were together. I
wonder if you would love him now—if you could
see him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you,” she said, in a low
voice. “Why should I not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because—well because he wouldn’t look nice,”
he responded, with a grim laugh. “In a word—because
he’s dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the mind of the girl there floated the
words the little man who had accompanied Harry
had spoken—“One is dead—the other living!”
But she said nothing; she was almost afraid to
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>speak, because she wanted so desperately to hear
what he had to say in explanation of that mystery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—he’s dead. He stood in my way—blocked
up the path which led to my desires. More than
that, I had made a tool of him for years—had used
him for every mean and petty thing I did not care
to soil my own hands with. He might have told
tales. Do you know what I did with him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him with a face of horror, and
slowly shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look round these walls—look at this miserable
place in which you stand. It should have a value
in your eyes; for it has heard his death scream.
Within a dozen yards of it, on the bank of this river—at
night—I struck him down. And I’d strike
him down again to-night, if he stood alive before
me. And you—you thought to defy a man who
felt the killing of that puny lover of yours no more
than he would have felt the killing of a rat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had felt it, though—and he felt it still; or
why did his hands tremble in their grip of the table,
and why did he glance for a moment, with that
blanched face, behind him?</p>

<p class='c009'>She, too, began to fear him now, as she had not
feared him before; looked about her wildly, as if
for a way of escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah—you shake and tremble now—do you?”
he said, mockingly. “You’ll tremble more when
you know what I intend to do. Think of it. You’re
here, far away from any houses, and you may scream
your heart out, and no one will hear you. Whatever
love I felt for you has gone—turned into a
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>viler thing. By God—pretty Miss Innocence”—he
brought his fist down heavily on the table—“you
shall dally with me an hour or two—for the first
and last time; and then go join your lover in the
river!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He darted round the table towards her; but she
evaded him, screaming, and made straight towards
where Philip stood. Ogledon, in his mad rush,
tripped and fell; and, at the same moment, Philip
caught the girl, swung her round into the darkness
where he had been standing, and stepped out into
the light.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was all done so rapidly, that Ogledon was on
his feet, and had actually come on, with a blind rush,
before he saw who stood in his path; and even
then, he had no time to stop himself—scarcely time
even to cry out. In a moment, Philip had him by
the throat, and had forced him to his knees; bending
over him, and looking full into his ghastly face,
he spoke the first words that rose to his lips; re-assumed,
for a moment, that character he had taken
upon himself near that very spot but a week or two
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy Chater is dead—is he? Struck down by
your hand from behind in the dark—murderer!
Do you look into his eyes now—in this place where
you killed him—or will you still cry that Dandy
Chater has not come back from the grave?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The face into which Philip Chater looked, suddenly
changed horribly; mouthed and chattered at
him, in some unearthly tongue; and the head fell
backwards. He felt the body relax, and droop under
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>his hands; heard a sort of gasping cry; and then
it slid out of his grasp to the floor. At the same
moment, the door was flung open, and the place
seemed full of people.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the front of them were some constables—and,
just behind them, the face of the Shady ’un. Philip
had a dim idea that Madge had come out into the
light, and was bending over the prostrate form of
Ogledon. He knew, too, that handcuffs were on his
wrists, and that he was strongly held by a couple
of men. Some others had gone to Ogledon, and
were raising him up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—take me,” he cried, recklessly; “I don’t
mind now; my innocence is proved. Look to that
man”—he pointed towards Ogledon—“he knows
my story; he is my chief witness!”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the men, who had been bending over Ogledon,
got up and adjusted his chin-strap, and looked
at Philip curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid your witness won’t do you much
good,” he said, shortly. “The man is dead!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />A RACE FOR A LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Shady ’un, in the vindictiveness of his temper,
had a word or two to say to the stricken man,
before he was marched off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re the bloke wot took ’old of me by the
windpipe—ain’t yer?” he said, going close up to
Philip, and thrusting his face forward at him. “Let
this ’ere be a warnin’ to yer not ter tike ’old of other
chap’s windpipes in futur’. You’ve done me rather
a good turn—you ’ave, Mister Dandy Chater; there
was a ’underd pound a ’angin’ to you—for sich infermation
as would lead to you bein’ nabbed—an’
that ’underd pound is mine. I calls all these ’ere
gents to witness,” he cried, raising his voice, and
looking round about him—“as I brought yer all to
this place, an’ nabbed ’im meself. An’ I’m a goin’
ter stick to these ’ere noble coppers, till I gits my
’underd pound!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Philip was marched away, he turned
towards Madge—who stood with her face buried in
her hands—and made one last appeal to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear girl,” he said, in a voice scarcely above a
whisper—“there is but one way to save me now—but
one hope left for me. Before God I am innocent.
Find Dr. Cripps!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no time to say more; they took him
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>off at once—meeting, at the very door of the place,
the doctor who had been sent for to examine the
dead man. Madge followed the little party out,
and saw Philip placed in a cab, with three constables
inside and another on the box—and driven off;
the Shady ’un—still in pursuit of his “’underd
pound”—running after the cab, as if his very life
depended on keeping it in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the stress of the moment Madge Barnshaw had
lost all idea of time or place—indeed of everything.
She quite forgot in what neighbourhood she stood
or at what hour; and was only roused by hearing
a voice address her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I asks yer pardon, young lady—for a speakin’
of sich a trim built craft, without leave—but this
ain’t no place for you to be a standin’ about alone
in. If so be as you’ve lost yer way, put yer faith
in a old mariner as knows the points of Life’s compass
a bit, an’ let ’im tow yer into wotever ’arbour
you may be bound for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This extraordinary speech was delivered at such
a rapid rate, and in so hoarse a whisper that Madge
had no time to interpose a word, or to check the
flow of words. Moreover, on looking at the face of
the speaker, whatever indignation she might have
been disposed to feel melted away; for it was a
good kind honest face—ruddy with much exposure
to wind and weather, and fringed with a luxuriant
growth of tangled hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My lass—I’m a married man—(an’ well I
knows it, w’en Mrs. Quist ain’t got ’er temper
ironed out straight!)—and there ain’t no ’arm in
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>me. But there’s a few craft of a queer rig in these
waters—and you’ll do well not to stay in ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madge made up her mind at once to trust him;
explained briefly that she knew nothing of the
neighbourhood, and had merely come there to keep
an appointment. And then, without more ado, she
suddenly turned round—made a frantic effort to stand
upright—and dropped into the man’s arms. The
scenes through which she had passed so recently
had utterly unnerved her, and Miss Madge Barnshaw
was lying in a dead faint in the arms of
Captain Peter Quist.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain’s first thought was to shout for
help; his next, to carry the girl to some place where
he could procure something which would revive her.
Glancing about him eagerly, he caught sight of the
lighted windows of The Three Watermen; and,
without a moment’s delay, half carried and half
supported her through the door, and into the little
private bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only one person happened to be in that bar at
the time—a little man, seated in a corner, half
asleep, with a glass of spirits beside him. The
Captain, entering hurriedly with his burden, looked
round, and cried out—“Give me some brandy—quick!
an’ tell me w’ere I can find a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the mention of that last word, the little man
in the corner staggered to his feet; swayed uneasily
for a moment; and then came towards the Captain,
with what dignity he could muster on such short
notice. But his eyes no sooner fell upon the Captain,
and then upon the girl, than he uttered a sort
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>of cry—spun completely round like an unsteady top—and
made for the door. But the Captain had
recognised him, too; and caught him just as he was
slipping out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ere ’old ’ard, mess-mate—’old ’ard,” exclaimed
the Captain, who had deposited his burden on a
bench and was able to give, for the moment, his
undivided attention to his captive. “You’re a man
as I wants to see, in ’arf a shake, so soon as I’ve
attended to this ’ere young lady. An’ per’aps, as
there don’t seem to be nobody else ’andy—p’raps
you can tell me w’ere I’ll find a doctor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little man—no other than Dr. Cripps—was
cowed by the superior size and strength of the
Captain and capitulated. “I—I am a doctor,” he
said, giving himself a sort of shake, probably with
the object of pulling himself together—and bending
over Madge, who had begun to open her eyes, and
to look about her. “Ah—nothing more than a
temporary faintness, as I imagined.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned round suddenly, and went to the bar,
and hammered on it with his fists, and shouted out
in a voice sufficient to be heard at the other end
of the house. “Hi—hi—why the devil don’t you
look after business, all of you! Here’s brandy
wanted—and all sorts of things—and yet any
one might die, and be buried forty times over,
before you’d turn a hair. Hi—hi—where are you
all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A surly-looking man came slowly out of an inner
room, and advanced to the bar. “All right—all
right—you needn’t shout the ’ouse down, Dr.
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>Cripps,” he said, stooping to get what was wanted,
and glancing carelessly at the girl as he did so.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it happened that the brandy was not required;
for the mere mention of the name of Cripps
was sufficient to rouse Madge, as nothing else could
have done. She sprang up at once, and caught the
little man by the shoulders, and looked into his eyes.
Cripps, for his part, began to shake and to tremble
very much; for he remembered the fifty pounds she
had paid him, and wondered whether or not she
wanted it back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you Dr. Cripps?” she asked, staring at him
intently. “Yes—I see you are. What Providence
has sent you to me at this time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madam,” said the Doctor, feebly, “if it would
be any use for me to deny my own identity I would
most willingly do so. I have been hunted and
badgered to an extent beyond all belief; I have
been dragged about in the dead of night—sworn at—carried
miles on hay waggons, without a chance
of obtaining natural and necessary refreshments;
and all because my name happens to be Cripps.
But I give in, Madam; I am vanquished; do what
you will with me—but let me finish my liquor.”
He walked across to where his glass stood, and
drained it, and then looked expressively at the
Captain. But nothing came of that; and at last
beginning dimly to see, in the coming of these two
people—each connected, in such a different fashion,
with his recollections of Dandy Chater—something
which he had to face, whispered the landlord over
the bar for a moment, and then turned again to them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>“If you want me—if you have anything private
to say,” he said—“you had better come upstairs;
there is a room there, of which I can claim the use.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And in which you an’ me met some little time
back,” said the Captain, nudging him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cripps led the way upstairs, and ushered them
into the same room in which the meeting had been
held not so long before. Carefully shutting the
door, he motioned to them to be seated, and stood
looking at them curiously, and waiting for them to
speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A day or two since,” began Madge, speaking
with much eagerness, and looking straight at the
Doctor, “I paid you a large sum for certain information
concerning Mr. Dandy Chater——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ullo!” broke in the Captain, staring from one
to the other. “I asks yer pardon, Miss—but I
’adn’t no idea, w’en I took yer in tow, as you was
acquainted with my ole friend Phil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him in perplexity. “Nor am I,”
she said slowly. “I spoke of Mr. Dandy Chater,
who has been recaptured, and is to stand his trial
to-morrow for murder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dandy Chater is the false flag as ’e’s bin a sailin’
under,” replied the Captain. “But, anyways—call
’im Dandy Chater, or Phil Crowdy—or Phil Chater—’e’s
my pal, and I’m beatin’ up these ’ere quarters
for to find ’im.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again there flashed through Madge’s mind the
words the Doctor had spoken, about the one man
living, and the other dead; again there seemed to
ring in her ears the words of Ogledon, when he had
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>confessed to her that he had killed Dandy Chater.
Yet that same Dandy Chater had stood—alive and
well—in the hut by the river; that same Dandy
Chater was now on his way to Chelmsford Jail!</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said to-night,” she said, turning to Cripps—“that
I must find you—that you could save him.
I have heard that the trial will be held to-morrow.
Won’t you help me; won’t you tell me something
more than you told the other day? Think in what
a state of mind I am now left! The one man has
been murdered; the other, of whom you spoke, is
either Dandy Chater, or a total stranger to me.
How am I to find out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Doctor opened his mouth to speak, but the
Captain suddenly raised his hand, and checked him.
“Avast!” he said hoarsely—“I’ve got the bearings
of this ’ere business—an’ I’ve got it from Phil
’isself. An’ if so be as this ’ere young lady ’ll bear
with me, she shall ’ave the straight of it. Dandy
Chater—own twin brother to my pal Philip
Crowdy, or Philip Chater—was took out of the
river by this ’ere gent an’ myself a while back. I
’ad my reasons fer sayin’ nothink, an’ I cut an’
run.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I, too, had my reasons,” said Cripps, in a low
voice—“for I feared Ogledon, and my own connection
with him, and I suspected that Ogledon had
killed him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madge had laid her head down on the grimy
table, and was weeping bitterly. “Then it is true,”
she said, in a whisper—“Dandy Chater is dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Steady, my lass!” said the Captain, laying his
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>rough hand lightly on her shoulder—“Don’t give
way; for there’s summink I’ve got to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She raised her head, and looked full into his eyes.
Kindly eyes they were, and they smiled at her
sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A long while ago, my lass, there was a cruel
wrong done—a bright lad cut out of ’is ’ome, an’ all
that should ’ave bin ’is, an’ cast adrift, many miles
across the sea, without a name—an’ with the brand
of ’Bastard’ upon ’im. That lad was my pal Phil
Chater; an’ ’e was the twin brother of Dandy
Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the words singing in her ears—“The one
living—the other dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think on it, my lass,” went on the Captain
gently. “The one boy—an’ ’im the youngest—brought
up in luxury, an’ with powdered lacqueys
for to wait on ’im at every turn; the other—an’ ’im
the eldest—sent miles across the sea, an’ roughin’
it like any common child. Lost in the bush, ’e was—pitched
about from one place to another—’omeless,
friendless, without a compass. But—an’ mark you
this, my lass—if ever a boy steered ’isself straight
by the stars o’ God, that boy Phil did. An’ when
at last ’e comes ’ome, with no thought in ’is ’eart of
anythink but a ’earty greetin’ for ’is brother, an’ a
share-and-share alike business with that brother—an’
finds ’im dead—wot do ’e do? I put it to you,
Miss—wot do my pal Phil do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him, with a brighter face, and
slowly shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My pal Phil finds as that brother of ’is loved a
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>young gel—(an’ I don’t need look far, for to find
that young gel to-night!)—an’ was loved by ’er.
Phil is took for the real Dandy by that young gel—an’
’e loves ’er! Bein’ afeard that, if she knowed
the truth, she would cast ’im off, ’e takes ’is brother’s
place—’is brother’s sins—dips ’is clean ’ands, so
to speak, in the blood that guilty brother shed—an’
all—mark you this, my lass—all for love of that
young gel. An’, for love of ’er—the Judge will cry
‘Death!’ on Phil Chater to-morrer!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain, in his honest excitement and admiration,
had risen to his feet, and waved one arm
above his head. Madge had risen, too, with almost
equal excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was one man as could ’ave saved ’im—a
man of the name of Ogledon——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ogledon is dead,” said Madge. “He died to-night,
and can do neither good nor harm any more.
But we”—she looked round quickly at both men—“we
can save him; we can prove to all the world
that this man is innocent, and is suffering for another.
The trial is to-morrow—the first on the
day’s list. We must reach Chelmsford to-morrow
morning; we must save this man!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain looked at her, in an excess of admiration.
“My lass,” he said slowly—“I ain’t surprised
that my pal Phil should ’ave gorn through
wot ’e ’as, for sich a gel! I’d ’ave disowned ’im,
if ’e’d done less!”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>The sun is shining brightly outside the crowded
court-house; and men and women, densely packed
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>within the walls, glance up at the grimy windows,
and from them to the prisoner, and wonder, perhaps,
what he is thinking about. The prisoner, for
his part, scarcely makes a movement—scarcely turns
his weary eyes round when any one speaks. For
hope has gone out of him; the battle has been
fought and lost; the murderer of the real Dandy
Chater is dead and has carried his secret into another
Place where all secrets are known. The
crowd of faces about him bears but one stamp upon
it all—hard, unrelenting, vengeful, every face there
looks upon him with certainty as a dead man and
is glad to think that he gets what he deserves.</p>

<p class='c009'>There has been—as there always is in such cases—much
eloquence on both sides—and some dramatic
moments. At the present the jury are a little
tired of it, and the Judge palpably nods; for the
whole thing is such a foregone conclusion. The
great man who has come down specially instructed
by the Treasury, has pointed out that this, gentlemen,
is a case in which no considerations of social
standing, birth or position must be allowed to
weigh. Indeed, gentlemen of the most intelligent
jury, in the most intelligent country of the world, if
it be possible to make it a little hotter for the prisoner
than is made already, then, gentlemen, clearly
it is your duty to make it hotter. For this man—(a
most desperate character you must understand,
gentlemen—as witness the cloud of police about the
dock and even in the dock with him)—this man
had the advantages of a great name—a fine position—much
property. Yet, gentlemen, what have you
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>heard of him? He stands before you a convicted
forger, bank robber—burglar—and as you will have
thrust down your throats a little more, gentlemen,
a murderer! You have had a most honest gentleman
here to-day on whom stolen notes were passed
to cover the amount of a forgery committed by the
prisoner on his greatest friend. You have heard of
transactions whereby the estate handed down to
the prisoner has been gradually sapped away by
riotous living until not one stick of it remains that
is not encumbered or bartered away. And to-day,
gentlemen, in effect, behold the prisoner brought
before you to receive his just doom!</p>

<p class='c009'>All this and much more from the learned gentleman
instructed by the Treasury. A movement in
Court as the learned gentleman sits down and the
prisoner turns his eyes in the direction of a new
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new voice belongs to Mr. Andrew Banks,
rising young barrister; and Mr. Andrew Banks is
disposed to be flippant. For it must not be understood,
gentlemen of the jury, that because a man of
the station of life of the prisoner has run through
a fortune—or half-a-dozen fortunes for the matter
of that—and has made a mistake in the exuberance
of his heart in signing some one else’s name instead
of his own—it must really not be imagined, gentlemen,
that that man for that reason is capable of the
atrocious crime with which he stands charged. In
fact, this rising young barrister would have the
gentlemen of the jury believe that the fact of his
having done these things and done them in an
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>open-handed devil-may-care gentlemanly fashion,
rather redounds to his credit than otherwise—and
goes indeed far to prove him incapable of such a
crime as this. The rising young barrister would
beg to call the attention of this most intelligent
jury to the witnesses relied upon for the prosecution.
One—the witness in regard to the forgery
and the stolen notes—is a sixty per-cent. money-lender
who has doubtless bled the prisoner pretty
freely for years; the other—and a most unwilling
witness it must be remembered, gentlemen—is a
former servant of the prisoner and now on his own
confession out of a situation. In a word, gentlemen
of the jury, this rising young barrister absolutely
flouts the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution;
has a little to say about hearths and homes
and British liberties; and sits down amid a little
murmur of applause.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the rising young barrister is not so sanguine
as he appears, for he leans across towards his learned
brother from the Treasury and whispers before
that gentleman rises again—“Devilish uphill work!
Can’t get a word out of him—won’t suggest any
course of defence at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A few more words from the prosecution—wholly
unnecessary words, for the jury are whispering and
have obviously made up their minds. Then amid a
silence the Judge sums up; would evidently be
merciful if he could; but is compelled to point out
all the most damning facts against the prisoner—his
desperate attempts to regain his liberty—the absence
of any evidence to rebut the weight of testimony
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>brought forward by the prosecution. In a
word, gentlemen of the jury, your course is clear before
you, and you are called upon to do your duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>A whispering—a rustling—and a nodding of heads
among the jurymen; for it is not even necessary
for them to retire. Then amid a silence greater
even than before the usual questions are put and
the verdict—known long ago to every man and
every woman in the Court—is spoken in one word.
Guilty!</p>

<p class='c009'>As though that word loosed the pent-up emotions
and passions of the crowded place, and as though
the grim satisfaction at the supposed justice of the
thing can no longer be suppressed, a great cheer
breaks out and rolls through the Court and out
through echoing corridors into the street itself;
where it is taken up by hundreds of throats and
sent on and on to fill the town. Then following
immediately on it and as suddenly as though no
sound had been raised, fell a death-like silence; for
Judge and prisoner are face to face—eye to eye.
But though he were asked a thousand times, the
prisoner has nothing to offer—except the simple
words—“I am innocent.” Men whisper each other
that he seems stunned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some one glides behind the Judge and fits a
square of black on his wig. The Judge has actually
opened his mouth to speak, when there comes a
sudden commotion at the doors; cries of remonstrance;
people thrusting this way and that; and
foremost of a little knot of people who seem to be
fighting their way in—a woman.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>She stops for nothing—will be stopped by nothing.
Men fall back from before her as though she
had some power above mere humanity. Philip
Chater turning towards where she comes, has a dim
idea that Cripps—staggering and waving his arms;
Betty Siggs, with her arms stretched out towards
him; Captain Quist struggling fiercely with a
gigantic constable—are all about that central
figure. Then the imperious voice of the woman
rings out above all the tumult.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop—in God’s name! That man is not Dandy
Chater!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />GOING—GOING—GONE!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Six months had gone by since Dandy Chater—(or
Philip Chater as he really was)—stood on trial
for his life; and with the turn of the year, Quist’s
Royal Circus and Unparalleled Combination of
Equestrian Talent had come again to Bamberton.
Judging by the appearance of the Captain as he sat
smoking his pipe on the steps of his caravan, the
venture had been so far a profitable one; for the
Captain was somewhat rounded and ruddier even
than of old.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the afternoon of a warm and sunny day,
and the Captain was evidently very well pleased
with the day and the world in general and himself
in particular; for he smiled and chuckled over his
pipe and gave himself sundry little soft slaps on the
leg as though he had some joke which he greatly
relished. Finding presently that it was quite impossible
to keep the joke to himself, he threw his
head back a little and called softly through the
open door of the caravan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Missis!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A muffled voice inside demanded to know what
he wanted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s them there two turtle-doves?” asked
the Captain in a heavy whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>A sound as of some one moving in the caravan
was heard, and then Mrs. Quist came to the door
and stood above him. And Mrs. Quist—grim red-headed
female that she was—actually smiled also and
kicked Captain Quist softly in the small of the back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go ’long with yer!” she said laughing. “It’s
a pity there shouldn’t be some on ’em as plays the
turtle-dove a bit! We ain’t all like you was—I believe
you’d a done <i>your</i> courtin’ through a speakin’
trumpet of you’d ’ad your way—you was that public.
An’ I’m sure, considerin’ as ’ow they’ve only
bin married this mornin’, you might giv’ ’em time
to say a word or two to each other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ole gal,” responded the Captain solemnly—“w’en
I said ‘turtle-doves’ it were not to be took
sarcastic. I honours ’im for ’is feelin’, an’ I fairly
dotes on ’er blushes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Quist administered another kick to the Captain
but seemed well pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You an’ me, ole gal, ’ad not the figger ’eads for
beauty w’en we stood up afore the parson; we
might ’ave bin useful in our stations—but there’s
no denyin’ as we was ’omely; pleasant to look
upon if yer like—but ’omely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—yer needn’t rub it in,” retorted Mrs.
Quist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Far be it from me so to do, ole gal. But wot I
would say is this ’ere; that it’s a delight for to
look on them young ’uns as was married this
mornin’. Adam an’ Eve in the garding of Eden a
goin’ ’alves with the apple weren’t a prettier picture
than ’Arry an’ Clara—take my word of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>“Well Peter—I will say this for yer; that it was
a good day’s work for you w’en you done the ’andsome
by them young people. We ’aven’t any
chicks of our own—an’ that boy ’as got sich a way
with ’osses, that ’e was fairly born to look arter a
circus. An’ the gel—well, I took a fancy to that
child w’en fust she come to lodge with me at
Chelmsford.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Quist, with another friendly kick, returned
into the caravan, and the Captain continued to
smoke his pipe. Indeed, so engrossed was he with
the pipe and with his own pleasant reflections, that
he did not observe very closely a figure coming
along the road towards him; or if he looked at it
at all, saw in it merely a chance traveller and no
concern of his. But presently as the figure drew
nearer, a remarkable change came over the Captain.
Gradually the hand which held the pipe came away
from his mouth, bringing the pipe with it, but leaving
the mouth open; the placidity of the Captain’s
face changed and melted away, and in its place
came an expression of blank amazement. Then as
the figure came nearer still, amazement fled, and
with a shout the Captain leapt to the ground and
ran forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phil Chater! Phil Chater come back to see ’is
old pal!” he exclaimed, shaking the new-comer’s
hand again and again.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the Philip of six months before, save only
for a certain weariness about the eyes and some
lines in the face which had not been there before.
He stopped the Captain with a gesture of his hand
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>when that gentleman in his excitement would have
summoned Mrs. Quist to share his joy, and they sat
down together on the bank beside the patch of
grass on which the caravan stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to have a chat with you, old friend,
before going away again,” said Philip after a pause.
“So—coming to Bamberton to-day—for the last
time—on business, I thought as I heard that the
circus was here that I’d walk over. And how are
you prospering?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never better,” replied the Captain rubbing his
hands. “Whether it is, Phil, that the experience I
gained, so to speak, in a life on the rollin’ main is
valuable—or wot it is, I don’t know; but certain it
is that they comes to my circus w’erever I ’appens
to stop—an’ they claps their ’ands to a quite remarkable
extent, an’ they laughs at the clown over
’is oldest jokes, min’ yer—things as my poor ole
mother used to ’ush me ter sleep with—in sich a
way that the chap is a beginnin’ to give ’isself airs.
You remember the melancholy lookin’ man wot
’auled you out of the fly that night on this ’ere very
road—don’t yer? Well—I do assure you, Phil, that
that chap is a gettin’ fat on applause alone; ’is
things ’as bin let out twice in two months.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m delighted to hear it,” said Philip laughing.
“And how is Mrs. Quist?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine—an’ ’earty,” responded the Captain.
“More than all she’s a beginnin’ to take an interest
in ’osses an’ talks sometimes as if she’d lived over a
stable all ’er days. But—now you’ll be surprised
to ’ear this, Phil, I know you will—she won’t ’ear
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>of no fat ladies. Puts ’er foot on ’em, so to speak,
I do assure you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really?” said Philip, hiding a smile. “You
surprise me. But now I want to talk for a moment
about myself; for I may not have a chance of speaking
to you again—at any time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain looked at him in dismay. “Why—wot
do yer mean, Phil, my lad?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—to tell you the truth at once—I’m going
abroad,” replied Philip. “I made a mistake from
one point of view in ever coming back at all; I’ve
brought endless misery on any number of innocent
heads and have done no good—for I’m poorer than
when I came. My unfortunate brother had practically
got rid of everything that could be disposed
of and owed money all the way round. When
after my release I came to look into affairs, I found—or
rather I was advised—that I need not pay a
single penny of his debts; that as they had been
contracted by him while the property was not his,
but mine, as the elder brother, I might repudiate
everything. But of course I couldn’t do that; I
made up my mind to get rid of the place and pay
as much as possible of what was owing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ did you?” asked the Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip laughed somewhat bitterly. “Why no,”
he said. “For I found when it came to the point
of selling that I had nothing to sell; a certain Jew
money-lender held a mortgage on the place and on
every stick it contained. He’s selling it up to-day,
at this very hour. No, old friend, the game is
played out; and I start the world once more. I
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>have enough to carry me back to Australia and to
give me a little start there; and I sail in a few
days’ time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain was evidently very much depressed,
for he slowly shook his head and looked at the
ground with a troubled face. Philip Chater rallyingly
clapped him on the shoulder and began to
talk of other things.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come,” he said, “you must have lots of things
to talk to me about—and any amount of news for
me. There is one thing I should like to know very
much; what has become of little Clara Siggs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As if in answer to the question, the Captain raised
his head and softly touched Philip on the arm. “See
there she comes, Phil,” he said, “an’ under safe convoy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Philip Chater, looking in the same direction, saw
advancing towards them the girlish form of Clara
leaning on the arm of Harry Routley. He sprang
up to meet them and the girl advanced alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment there was silence between them;
the Captain had drawn apart and was talking with
Harry. Then Clara, looking up into Philip’s face,
told the end of her story so far as it could concern
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Chater—I was married this morning—and
am the happiest girl on earth. When I tried to
tell Harry that I had once in my wild wayward
fashion cared for your brother—he would not let
me speak; he kissed my lips to silence me. I
thought that I should like you to know that I am
very, very happy; that I am with people who are
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>good to me, and whom I love and respect, and that
whatever mad dream was once in my foolish heart
is buried as deep as the brother you never knew in
life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His heart was too full in that hour of parting to
say anything in reply; he held her hand for a moment
and then turned towards Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You thought badly of me once, Harry—and I’m
afraid you’ve been blaming yourself ever since for
any trouble you may have caused me. Don’t think
of it any more; you, like every one else, were working
in the dark. Now you understand and we part
the best of friends—don’t we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A little later Philip Chater set off towards Bamberton;
something seemed to draw him to the place
as it had never done before. He knew that the sale
had taken place that day and that Chater Hall was
lost to the Chaters forever; but he had a morbid
desire to see it once again that he might carry away
with him the remembrance of the home which had
never been his, into whatever exile he might be going.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was almost dark when he traversed that long
winding path which he had once watched as a
fugitive through a whole day. But he came at last
to the place and noticed, in the desolation of his
heart, that the great hall door stood open and that
all within seemed blank and empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder who has bought it,” he muttered to
himself, “and who will live here in the years to
come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There seemed to be no one about, and he walked
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>in and turned into that room into which he had
first gone on the occasion of his coming to Bamberton.
And being in the room stopped dead with his
heart beating suffocatingly; for there was a figure
standing in one of the windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew, even in the semi-darkness of the place,
that it was Madge Barnshaw before she turned her
head or spoke; something in the mere fact of her
being there told him that. He would have given
anything not to have met her at that time and in
that place; but there was no possibility of his getting
away—for she turned and saw him.</p>

<p class='c009'>She came quickly towards him and almost before
he knew her hand was in his and she was looking
straight into his eyes. “I wanted to see you,” she
said slowly. “I waited here—strange as it may
seem—in the hope that you would come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would it not have been better,” he replied bitterly,
“if you had never seen me at all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She shook her head and a smile played for a moment
about her lips. “That is an ungenerous thing
to say,” she replied. “Surely it is right that we
should meet here—in your home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mine no longer,” he said. “It was sold to-day
to pay some of the debts I took upon me when I took
the name of Dandy Chater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—and do you know who bought it?” she
asked almost in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Something in her face as she bent nearer to him,
still holding his hands, seemed to answer the question
without the need of any word from him. She
went on rapidly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>“When you first came to me, Philip, my heart
was full of pity for a man who had professed his
love for me often and often. Fool that I was, I
never saw that a better man stood in his place—spoke
with his voice—wooed me for his own sake
and not because of his dead brother! Philip, you
spoke just now of debts you have paid—and I know
of burdens you have borne—for the sake of that
brother. Philip”—she came nearer to him in the
darkness—“there is another debt you must pay
if you will, another burden you must bear. You
have taken upon yourself the name of Dandy
Chater, be Dandy Chater still to me—and love
me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held her in his arms even while he tried to
reason with his heart that it was not just nor fair.
But when she thrust the deeds of the house in his
hands; when she went upon her knees to him and
raised her pure face to his; when she prayed that
he would take the place that was his, in his home
and in her heart; what could he say?</p>

<p class='c009'>In effect it was all summed up clearly and fairly
that night by Mrs. Betty Siggs in the housekeeper’s
room to Mrs. Dolman in a moment of confidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sins as Master Dandy did ’as bin wiped out
an’ nothing need be said about ’em. Mark my
words, Mrs. Dolman, the time is coming when a
new Dandy Chater is a goin’ to reign at the ’All—a
Chater as’ll be a squire in summing more than
name! An’ more than that, Mum, there won’t be
no mistakes about this one; for ’e’s my dear boy,
an’ there ain’t another like ’im in the wide world.
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>An’ so, Mum,”—Mrs. Siggs raised her glass before
her smiling face, for they were discussing supper—“I
gives yer as a toast—‘The Second Dandy
Chater.’”</p>
